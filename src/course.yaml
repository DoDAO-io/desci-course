      DeSci is a movement creating public infrastructure for scientific
      knowledge through the Web3 stack.  It aims to incentivize scientists to
      share and receive credit for their work, while promoting transparency and
      accessibility to all. This decentralized approach allows for diverse
      funding sources, accessible data and methods, and incentives for
      reproducibility. It creates a more resistant research model to central
      authorities and promotes unconventional ideas.

      Molecule DAO is an ambitious project aimed at revolutionizing the drug
      development industry.  With a vision to create an open marketplace that
      connects patients directly with researchers,  Molecule DAO seeks to
      democratize access to funding for promising early-stage therapeutic
      research.

      VitaDAO is a cooperative organization for community-governed and
      decentralized drug development with the mission to accelerate research and
      development in the longevity space. They aim to democratize early-stage
      longevity research, which is lacking critical funding, by using a
      combination of novel governance frameworks and decentralized autonomous
      organizations (DAOs), non-fungible tokens (NFTs), and financial
      engineering tools. VitaDAO's ownership and governance are governed by VITA
      tokens, which can be obtained by contributing work, funds, or other
      resources. VitaDAO aims to acquire and finance new therapeutics and
      research data in the longevity space, and directly hold IP rights in novel
      early-stage therapeutics. They plan to create entirely new open IP
      business models that promote open science and new data marketplaces.
