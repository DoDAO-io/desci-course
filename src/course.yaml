      DeSci is a movement creating public infrastructure for scientific
      knowledge through the Web3 stack.  It aims to incentivize scientists to
      share and receive credit for their work, while promoting transparency and
      accessibility to all. This decentralized approach allows for diverse
      funding sources, accessible data and methods, and incentives for
      reproducibility. It creates a more resistant research model to central
      authorities and promotes unconventional ideas.

      Molecule DAO is an ambitious project aimed at revolutionizing the drug
      development industry.  With a vision to create an open marketplace that
      connects patients directly with researchers,  Molecule DAO seeks to
      democratize access to funding for promising early-stage therapeutic
      research.

    title: VitaDAO
    details: >-
      VitaDAO is a cooperative platform that aims to accelerate research and
      development (R&D) in the longevity space by attracting and democratizing
      the best and earliest longevity research. VitaDAO plans to achieve this
      goal by using a combination of governance frameworks, decentralized
      autonomous organizations (DAOs), non-fungible tokens (NFTs), and financial
      engineering tools such as algorithmic automated market makers (AMMs) that
      run on the Ethereum blockchain. VitaDAO seeks to align incentives and
      vitalize early-stage funding in longevity biopharma by creating entirely
      new open IP business models.


      VitaDAO's ownership and governance are managed through VITA tokens, which
      can be obtained by contributing work, funds, data, or intellectual
      property (IP) to VitaDAO. The holders of VITA tokens participate in the
      democratic governance of VitaDAO, direct its research, access and monetize
      its data repositories, and manage its IP portfolio.


      In the long run, VitaDAO aims to create entirely new open IP business
      models that promote open science and novel data marketplaces, allowing
      VitaDAO to monetize its IP and data assets. As an open cooperative, anyone
      can join and support VitaDAO. The platform is still in its early stages
      but has the potential to transform the biopharma industry by creating a
      more collaborative and transparent approach to R&D.
