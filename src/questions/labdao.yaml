  content: What is LabDAO's approach to accelerating progress in biomedicine?
  hint: NoHint
  explanation: LabDAO's approach involves creating an open exchange of wet-lab and dry-lab tooling, defining standards around biomedical tools to increase reproducibility and transparency, and incentivizing contributors to develop applications and provide instrumentation. LabDAO believes that abstracted infrastructure, such as cloud computing, has lowered the upfront cost of starting a new technology company.

  content: What is small molecule binding affinity?
  hint: NoHint
  explanation: The concept of small molecule binding involves investigating the interaction between a small molecule and a target, typically a protein. The process involves bringing the small molecule and the target into proximity, either through in silico or laboratory methods, with the aim of determining whether there is binding between them.
