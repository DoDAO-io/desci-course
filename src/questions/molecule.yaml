  content: What is the IP-NFT protocol?
  hint: NoHint
  explanation: IP-NFT (Intellectual Property - Non-Fungible Token) combines legal and smart contract primitives. This protocol enables the tokenization of intellectual property and research data, allowing for the creation of cryptographic tokens on the Ethereum blockchain. These tokens unify the legal rights, data access, and economics around research projects, allowing for more efficient and transparent management of research funding.
