    VitaDAO is a cooperative platform that aims to accelerate research and
    development (R&D) in the longevity space by attracting and democratizing the
    best and earliest longevity research. VitaDAO plans to achieve this goal by
    using a combination of governance frameworks, decentralized autonomous
    organizations (DAOs), non-fungible tokens (NFTs), and financial engineering
    tools such as algorithmic automated market makers (AMMs) that run on the
    Ethereum blockchain. VitaDAO seeks to align incentives and vitalize
    early-stage funding in longevity biopharma by creating entirely new open IP
    business models.


    VitaDAO's ownership and governance are managed through VITA tokens, which
    can be obtained by contributing work, funds, data, or intellectual property
    (IP) to VitaDAO. The holders of VITA tokens participate in the democratic
    governance of VitaDAO, direct its research, access and monetize its data
    repositories, and manage its IP portfolio.


    In the long run, VitaDAO aims to create entirely new open IP business models
    that promote open science and novel data marketplaces, allowing VitaDAO to
    monetize its IP and data assets. As an open cooperative, anyone can join and
    support VitaDAO. The platform is still in its early stages but has the
    potential to transform the biopharma industry by creating a more
    collaborative and transparent approach to R&D.

     The organization aims to improve the yield of existing public investment in longevity projects and enable democratic participation in longevity projects. VitaDAO plans to work hand-in-hand with existing organizations to improve their infrastructure.

    ### VitaDAO Aim 1 - Improve the yield of existing public investment in
    longevity projects

    VitaDAO plans to build a bridge to efficiently link non-profit and
    for-profit funding, particularly around universities where a significant
    percentage of technologies go unutilized. VitaDAO aims to leverage
    Molecule's IP-NFT marketplace to help universities monetize their assets.
    VitaDAO's approach is to build bridges to fix existing roads.


    ### VitaDAO Aim 2 - Enable democratic participation in longevity projects

    VitaDAO will facilitate initiatives where intellectual property is not
    relevant to enable democratic participation in longevity projects.
    Researchers and pharma companies typically focus on patents, but VitaDAO
    will drive success through crowdfunding and social impact bonds. NFTs might
    not be relevant in these cases, but VitaDAO can still distribute its $VITA
    tokens based on contributions. The organization aims to fix the money in
    healthcare to fix the world, particularly in the blockchains and Web3 space.
