    VitaDAO is a cooperative platform that aims to accelerate research and
    development (R&D) in the longevity space by attracting and democratizing the
    best and earliest longevity research. VitaDAO plans to achieve this goal by
    using a combination of governance frameworks, decentralized autonomous
    organizations (DAOs), non-fungible tokens (NFTs), and financial engineering
    tools such as algorithmic automated market makers (AMMs) that run on the
    Ethereum blockchain. VitaDAO seeks to align incentives and vitalize
    early-stage funding in longevity biopharma by creating entirely new open IP
    business models.


    VitaDAO's ownership and governance are managed through VITA tokens, which
    can be obtained by contributing work, funds, data, or intellectual property
    (IP) to VitaDAO. The holders of VITA tokens participate in the democratic
    governance of VitaDAO, direct its research, access and monetize its data
    repositories, and manage its IP portfolio.


    In the long run, VitaDAO aims to create entirely new open IP business models
    that promote open science and novel data marketplaces, allowing VitaDAO to
    monetize its IP and data assets. As an open cooperative, anyone can join and
    support VitaDAO. The platform is still in its early stages but has the
    potential to transform the biopharma industry by creating a more
    collaborative and transparent approach to R&D.
