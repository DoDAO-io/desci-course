  title: What is Molecule?
  shortTitle: Molecule
  details: >
    Molecule DAO is an ambitious project aimed at revolutionizing the drug
    development industry. With a vision to create an open marketplace that
    connects patients directly with researchers, Molecule DAO seeks to
    democratize access to funding for promising early-stage therapeutic
    research. The team behind Molecule DAO believes that by utilizing a
    combination of unique digital asset identifiers (NFTs), automatic exchange
    infrastructure, and governance structures, they can reinvent IP ownership
    and financing of these assets in a decentralized manner. Ultimately,
    Molecule DAO hopes to create a new creator economy for researchers that
    allows for the rapid funding, discovery, and development of therapeutics
    through globally connected patient collectives. In this introduction, we
    explore the challenges that the drug development industry currently faces
    and how Molecule DAO aims to address them.


    Molecule operates across three different areas: protocol development,
    marketplace creation, and BioDAO launchpad.


    Firstly, Molecule has created a new protocol called IP-NFT (Intellectual
    Property - Non-Fungible Token) which combines legal and smart contract
    primitives. This protocol enables the tokenization of intellectual property
    and research data, allowing for the creation of cryptographic tokens on the
    Ethereum blockchain. These tokens unify the legal rights, data access, and
    economics around research projects, allowing for more efficient and
    transparent management of research funding.


    Secondly, Molecule is building a marketplace on top of the IP-NFT protocol,
    called Molecule Discovery. The marketplace enables researchers and funders
    to connect and collaborate on translational research projects. Researchers
    can propose research ideas, which are evaluated by funders and negotiated on
    the platform, resulting in funding agreements. The marketplace aims to
    improve the funding process for research projects by providing a more
    streamlined and transparent platform for collaboration.


    Thirdly, Molecule operates a BioDAO launchpad, which incubates decentralized
    biotech IP and R&D organizations called BioDAOs. These communities consist
    of patients, researchers, and enthusiasts who come together to fund research
    in specific therapeutic areas. The BioDAO launchpad fosters demand and
    supply for the marketplace by incubating and supporting BioDAOs through an
    accelerator program. This program helps to create a new class of
    decentralized biotech organizations that can help to accelerate the
    development of new therapeutics and treatments.

    #### What is IP-NFT?


    IP-NFT stands for Intellectual Property - Non-Fungible Token. Molecule
    created the first IP-NFTs for [VitaDAO](https://www.vitadao.com/), which
    enabled them to register their intellectual property and research and
    development data rights for their sponsored research in longevity
    therapeutics. By attaching legal contracts such as sponsored research
    agreements to smart contracts, IP-NFTs connect IP and R&D data rights to
    NFTs on the [Ethereum](https://www.ethereum.org/) blockchain. IP-NFTs serve
    as the [building
    blocks](https://molecule.to/blog/ip-nfts-for-researchers-a-new-biomedical-funding-paradigm)
    for decentralized science (DeSci), much like [DeFi
    legos](https://www.defipulse.com/blog/what-is-defi) for DeSci. They
    represent a new paradigm in the evolution of legal contracts for scientific
    research, moving from paper or electronic file folders to smart contracts on
    the Ethereum blockchain. IP-NFTs can be transferred peer-to-peer, made
    [composable](https://blog.aragon.org/what-is-composability/) with DeFi,
    fractionalized to distribute licenses and governance to groups of people.
    They can also be built upon to unlock new ways to interact with and develop
    IP, R&D data, and
    [NIPIA](https://www.aaup.org/sites/default/files/files/IntangibleAssets.pdf)
    (Non-IP Intangible Assets). 


    #### Why mint an IP-NFT?


    An IP-NFT can be minted by a research sponsor, biotech company, or
    researcher to benefit from the attachment of intellectual property (IP) and
    research and development (R&D) rights to an Ethereum smart contract. As
    described above, the benefits of IP-NFTs include:

    - Permissionless peer-to-peer transferability as smart contracts on Ethereum
    - Composability with DeFi - Fractionalization for the distribution of
    licenses and governance to groups of individuals - Development of new ways
    to interact with and develop IP, R&D data, and Non-IP Intangible Assets
    (NIPIA) such as trade secrets and publicity rights - Empowerment of crowd
    control of ethics in commercialization based on FRAND terms - Unprecedented
    liquidity in IP markets


    In addition, IP-NFTs offer non-dilutive funding opportunities for
    researchers seeking to sell IP and data rights without having to apply for
    grants or sell shares of spin-off companies. Once an IP-NFT is minted, the
    user has attached the specified IP, NIPIA, and R&D data rights to a
    non-fungible token on Ethereum. These rights transfer with the token when it
    is transferred, providing ease of transferability and verified ownership of
    rights through the blockchain.

    Other reasons to mint IP-NFTs include:

    - **Composability with DeFi**: IP-NFTs can be used as building blocks in
    DeSci and [mixed with other software components like lego
    bricks](https://twitter.com/cdixon/status/1451703070589587456?s=20&t=GsFYFskx2cmqYnUjL1PGuw).
    For instance, they can be used as collateral to mint stablecoins in
    MakerDAO, traded on marketplaces like [OpenSea](https://opensea.io/) and
    [Gem](https://www.gem.xyz/), or listed in a bespoke IP marketplace like
    [Molecule
    Discovery](https://molecule.to/blog/an-open-bazaar-for-drug-development-molecule-protocol).
    Fractionalization (IP-NFT fractionalization is a technique that allows for
    the direct distribution of IP-NFT rights to groups of token holders by
    locking the IP-NFT and generating tokens on Ethereum that represent
    fractions of the locked IP-NFT) is also possible on platforms like
    [Fractional.art](http://www.fractional.art/) and the FRENS & FAM legal+smart
    contract protocol.

    - **Creation of efficiencies in IP licensing**: IP-NFTs provide transparency
    in IP ownership and valuation, which can make due diligence for licensing
    deals easier and less costly.

    - **Creation of entirely new IP markets**: Early-stage IP-NFTs can represent
    rights to future IP arising from a research project, while late-stage
    IP-NFTs can represent trade secrets and patents on inventions that arise
    from the project. Licensing terms, ethical conditions, and governance
    clauses can be encoded into IP-NFTs as license wrappers. This allows for
    efficient trading of IP rights before pursuing patents and the potential for
    a Cambrian explosion of novel applications for decentralized IP ownership,
    governance, and commercialization.


    To mint an IP-NFT using Molecule, follow these steps:


    - **Request a mintpass**: Minting of IP-NFTs on Molecule is currently in
    closed beta, so you'll need to request a mintpass to get started. You can
    request [here](https://airtable.com/shr9QN0tPPeK4GGjA). - **Create and sign
    a legal agreement**: Two parties must negotiate and sign a legal contract
    that includes two agreements. The first agreement states the rights of the
    asset holder and the price paid for the asset, while the second agreement
    assigns the rights of the buyer within the first agreement to the holder of
    a certain token of the IP-NFT smart contract. - **Access the minting
    front-end**: Visit the [minting front-end](https://mint.molecule.to/) and
    connect your wallet to get started with the process. - **Reserve an
    IP-NFT**: To enable the encryption of your documents, Molecule reserves a
    TokenID for your NFT. This TokenID will be used to ensure that only the
    owner of the TokenID can access the data behind the NFT. - **Describe your
    IP-NFT**: Add all the information about your IP-NFT, including what kind of
    agreement will be connected to the IP-NFT and whether the agreement should
    be stored publicly or privately. All information in this step will be saved
    in the metadata of the IP-NFT and will be publicly available. - **Attach
    your signed legal agreement and artwork**: Upload the signed legal agreement
    from step 2 to the Molecule Platform. This document will be encrypted and
    stored on a decentralized data storage. Additionally, add artwork to become
    the memorable image of your IP-NFT. - **Review your IP-NFT data**: Review
    the data submitted for the IP-NFT. Once ready, continue the process. After
    submitting your data in this step, the contract will be encrypted and
    uploaded to the decentralized data storage. The decryption key will be
    stored with Lit Protocol to manage access control based on the NFT
    ownership. - **Sign IP-NFT minting transaction**: Your metamask will pop-up
    and ask you to sign a transaction to mint the IP-NFT. - **View your
    IP-NFT**: Once the transaction goes through, you will find an IP-NFT in your
    wallet. Congratulations, you have successfully created an IP-NFT!

  title: Molecule Discovery
  shortTitle: Molecule Discovery
  details: >
    Molecule Discovery is a platform that features various biopharma research
    projects from across the globe. Researchers present their projects in
    different therapeutic areas. The platform allows you to sort projects based
    on clinical stages and opportunity types. Additionally, there is a free text
    search option available to make it easier to find relevant research
    projects.


    Molecule Discovery offers user accounts that facilitate collaboration on
    various research projects. Researchers can create and manage their own
    projects using their accounts, while investors can inquire about projects
    and whitelist to fund researchers.


    Molecule's primary goal is to assist biopharma researchers in finding
    resources and partners to execute their research projects. One of the most
    common issues in early-stage biopharma research is the difficulty in
    acquiring funding and the length of time it takes to secure such funding.
    This issue can arise due to a variety of factors, such as complex contracts,
    limited access to funding sources, and challenges in aligning multiple
    stakeholders.


    To address these obstacles, Molecule has developed a unique IP-NFT
    framework. Our team has created a set of standardized legal agreements that
    are linked to non-fungible tokens, enabling researchers to receive funding
    from existing early-stage investors. This approach aims to simplify the
    funding process and streamline the acquisition of necessary resources for
    biopharma research.
- key: biodao
  title: Bio DAO
  shortTitle: Bio DAO
  details: >
    A BioDAO is a type of Decentralized Autonomous Organisation (DAO) that uses
    decentralised services in the field of decentralised science (DeSci) to
    shape the future of therapeutic development. DAOs are made up of communities
    of individuals with diverse backgrounds who jointly allocate resources
    towards a common goal. When it comes to financial resources, public
    decentralised ledger technology such as Ethereum is used to enable all
    parties to collaborate in a trustless manner and democratically decide on
    how to allocate resources.


    One of the key services offered by BioDAOs is the tokenization of
    intellectual property (IP) rights using non-fungible tokens (NFTs) to create
    liquid IP-NFTs. These IP-NFTs can be bought, held, managed, and sold by
    DAOs, allowing them to contribute to the advancement of science.


    #### Different Types of BioDAOs

    - **Community & Therapeutic Areas**: DAOs can be created by existing
    communities or individuals interested in a particular therapeutic area.
    Examples include VitaDAO and PsyDAO, which actively support research in
    their respective areas and educate the community through AMAs, Twitter
    Spaces, and other content.

    - **Nonprofits and Patient Organizations**: Nonprofits and patient
    organizations can be structured as DAOs to use Web3 fundraising mechanisms
    for public goods. This allows more people to take an active role in the BIO
    Ecosystem and support neglected and underfunded research areas. An excellent
    example is Crowdfunded Cures and To Cure a Rose, which create new value
    layers in the therapeutic space.

    - **Service Provider DAOs**: With the adoption of the IP-NFT standard and
    more efforts to conduct research in a decentralized way, we will see more
    DAOs actively building tools and services for researchers, such as LabDAO
    and CureDAO.

    - **Investment Syndicates**: DAOs don't have to consist of a large number of
    contributors; they can start as small as two individuals who collectively
    want to pool funds and support therapeutic research over our Discovery
    Platform as a Syndicate.

    - **BioLAOs**: A BioLAO is a community of BIO enthusiasts and experts who
    support the work of researchers and builders through advice and capital.


    #### The BIO DAO Lifecycle

    DAOs go through different stages, from an idea to a fully grown
    organization. The growth sequence for a BioDAO typically includes specific
    building blocks. Molecule provides support at each of these stages.
