  title: What is DeSci?
  shortTitle: What is DeSci
  details: >
    > Decentralized science (DeSci) is a movement that aims to build public
    infrastructure for funding, creating, reviewing, crediting, storing, and
    disseminating scientific knowledge fairly and equitably using the Web3 stack
    â€“ Ethereum.org 


    There is a lot to unpack in this definition, with each term such as
    "funding, creating, reviewing, crediting, storing, and disseminating"
    requiring detailed explanation. Undoubtedly, science has played a major role
    in making the world a better place for humans than ever before. Private
    industry readily supports areas of innovation that promise short-term
    financial gains, while research in fields that lack direct monetary
    benefits, such as space exploration, bio research, and pollution control,
    rely heavily on government funding. Unfortunately, the outcomes of such
    research often prioritize theoretical publications over real-world impact.


    DeSci is an experimental field that takes cues from open-source software
    development, as well as DeFi and Decentralized Autonomous Organization
    concepts, to streamline and optimize the entire research process. By
    employing mechanisms such as public open grants, incentivized coordination,
    effort tracking, and reward distribution, DeSci aims to make research more
    efficient and effective.


    Although DeSci concepts can be applied in any sector, there has been a
    notable increase in the adoption of decentralized concepts and primitives
    within the field of biopharma. Therefore, this course will specifically
    concentrate on the implementation of DeSci in the biopharma science domain.

    While the traditional approach to science has led to numerous advancements,
    it has not kept pace with technological advancements, resulting in a
    deteriorating process. Similar to government bodies, science institutions
    also face several issues, primarily due to centralization of
    decision-making. Additionally, the focus has shifted from making an impact
    to publishing research papers. Some of the most significant problems
    currently faced by the traditional science industry are discussed below.


    ## Issues with Technology Transfer Offices (TTOs)

    Technology transfer offices (TTOs) play an important role in translating
    scientific research into practical applications and products that benefit
    society. However, researchers from TTOs face several challenges and issues,
    including conflicts with tenure and promotion policies, limited resources,
    complex legal and regulatory requirements, and difficulties in identifying
    potential commercial partners.


    TTOs can face issues with intellectual property management,
    commercialization and licensing, funding and budget constraints, legal and
    regulatory compliance, collaboration and partnerships, and limited knowledge
    of business and entrepreneurship. In addition, cultural differences and
    language barriers can create challenges for researchers working across
    multiple countries and regions.


    Unethical behavior by TTO staff can also create issues, leading to
    resentment from faculty researchers. Additionally, some faculty researchers
    may have disdain for TTO staff and commercialization, which can lead to
    public disputes between faculty and universities, raising ethical questions
    of retaliation against whistleblowers. Clear ethical behavior standards are
    needed to prevent conflicts of interest, and pressure to publish, earn
    tenure, and commercialize products can lead to researchers violating
    university policies unethically.


    ## Commercialization issues

    Biopharma researchers face several challenges related to the
    commercialization of their research, including regulatory hurdles,
    intellectual property (IP) concerns, and the high cost of drug development.
    The regulatory process is lengthy and expensive, and often requires
    researchers to conduct multiple clinical trials before their drug can be
    approved for commercialization. Additionally, the regulatory landscape is
    constantly evolving, and researchers must stay up-to-date with changes in
    regulations and guidelines to ensure compliance.


    Another major challenge is protecting the intellectual property associated
    with biopharmaceuticals. Patents are critical to securing market exclusivity
    and recouping the substantial investment required to develop a drug.
    However, protecting intellectual property can be challenging, particularly
    in cases where the underlying science is complex and difficult to replicate.
    Finally, drug development is a high-risk, high-reward endeavor, and failure
    rates are high. Only a small fraction of compounds that enter the
    development pipeline ultimately make it to market, and the cost of those
    that do is often high. As a result, biopharma researchers must be able to
    identify promising candidates early on, and effectively manage the risks
    associated with drug development to achieve commercial success.


    ## Funding - New

    Biopharmaceuticals typically require a significant amount of funding to
    bring a new drug or therapy to market. This can include the cost of clinical
    trials, regulatory approvals, and manufacturing. Investors may be hesitant
    to invest in biopharma research due to the high level of risk involved in
    bringing a new drug to market, which can lead to a lack of funding for
    promising research projects.


    Another challenge faced by biopharma researchers is the competitive nature
    of the industry. There are many research projects underway in the biopharma
    sector, and investors may be hesitant to invest in a project that is not
    perceived as being innovative or groundbreaking. This can lead to a lack of
    funding for promising research projects, even if they have the potential to
    make a significant impact on patient care. Additionally, there may be
    limited funding available for research projects that are focused on rare
    diseases or conditions, as these projects may not have a large enough market
    to be financially viable. All of these factors can make it challenging for
    biopharma researchers to secure the funding they need to bring their
    research to fruition.


    ## Collaboration Issues

    there are several challenges that biopharma researchers face when it comes
    to collaboration. One of the primary issues is the competitive nature of the
    industry. Companies may be reluctant to collaborate with their competitors
    for fear of losing their competitive advantage. This can make it difficult
    for researchers to access critical resources, such as patient data or
    specialized equipment.


    Another challenge is the lack of standardization in data and research
    protocols. Biopharma researchers often use different methods for collecting
    and analyzing data, which can make it difficult to compare results between
    studies. This can be particularly problematic when trying to replicate the
    results of a study, which is a crucial step in the drug development process.
    Additionally, regulatory agencies may have different requirements for
    clinical trials and data collection, which can create additional barriers to
    collaboration. 


    ## Funding

    Funding problems plague both the public and private sectors in science.
    Science startups face more intense funding challenges than other startups as
    their product turnaround time is longer, and initial setup costs are higher.
    Private VCs invest based solely on risk/reward and not impact.


    In the public sector, the grant mechanisms used by government entities are
    outdated and favor field veterans. It is easier to obtain funding for newer
    initiatives, which means grantees focus on completing current projects and
    starting new ones rather than ensuring long-term usefulness of current
    projects. Grant distribution is also biased, with veterans giving grants to
    other veterans, making it challenging for new members to secure funding.


    ## Relevance

    Most research done by PhDs is buried in research papers, and the focus is
    solely on publishing rather than applicability of research. Academic
    institutions have minimum publication requirements for tenured positions.
    After research is published, academics do not make an effort to ensure the
    industry is aware of it or that others can use their research.


    Furthermore, many researchers prioritize using checklists for methods
    applicability, data availability, and result derivability, rather than
    focusing on novelty of topics or ideas. Newer areas have relatively less
    literature or data available, making it challenging to apply existing models
    or methods, which discourages working on the latest trends.


    ## Research Collaboration

    Traditionally, academic and scientific research has been conducted in
    isolation, with little effort made to build upon the work of others or to
    facilitate collaboration. However, with the advent of modern coordination
    mechanisms, such as those used in open-source software projects, it is now
    possible for researchers to work together in a more transparent and
    efficient manner. These projects allow for open collaboration and provide
    easy access to project resources, enabling new team members to quickly get
    up to speed with the project.


    ## Intellectual Property Ownership

    Intellectual property (IP) refers to legal rights granted to inventors and
    creators, such as patents, copyrights, and trademarks. However, the rules
    for IP ownership and transfer can vary significantly between research
    institutions. In many cases, the IP produced by researchers is not easily
    transferable or awarded in a flexible manner that reflects the contributions
    of team members.


    ## Reward Distribution

    Despite the potential market value of the IP produced, there is often a lack
    of reward structures in place for researchers. This can lead to a shift in
    focus from the research itself to obtaining a tenured position.
    Additionally, there is often no clear or flexible way to distribute rewards
    based on individual contributions to the project.

  title: DeSci Benefits
  shortTitle: DeSci Benefits
  details: >+
    DeFi has the potential to address many of the problems we discussed earlier,
    and DeSci, while still experimental, has garnered a lot of attention. There
    are real-world projects targeting these areas and making significant
    progress. Our focus is to learn from the new primitives and projects in
    order to determine what we can borrow and apply in our own project or
    situation. Let's explore the benefits provided by DeSci.


    ## Assistance with Funding

    As we previously mentioned, it is easy to raise funds in a transparent
    manner using DeFi primitives like Bonding Curves and Liquidity Bootstrapping
    Pools. In DeSci, even more innovative formats are being used for funding.
    Communities or Decentralized Autonomous Organizations are formed around
    causes such as Longevity, Psychedelics, and Hair Loss. These communities
    have their own tokens that help create a treasury, and members vote to
    select the projects or researchers to fund. Even traditional pharma players
    are participating in these models. For example, VitaDAO, a DAO focused on
    raising funds for research on extending human life, closed a $4.1 million
    funding round with Pfizer Ventures and several others.


    ## Flexible Intellectual Property Ownership

    DeSci uses Ethereum's ERC-20 tokens and ERC-721 NFT standards to represent
    intellectual property on the blockchain. Molecule has developed an "IP-NFT"
    as an Intellectual Property primitive. These IP-NFTs connect IP and research
    data rights to NFTs using legal contracts attached to smart contracts. They
    represent a new paradigm in legal contracts for scientific research and are
    stored on Ethereum. IP-NFTs can be transferred, used in DeFi,
    fractionalized, and enable crowd control of ethics in commercialization.
    They also bring unprecedented liquidity to IP markets.


    ## Reputation instead of Citation

    DeFi and blockchain are currently experimenting with many reputation
    primitives like badges, soulbound tokens, and non-transferrable tokens,
    which can be used to encourage a multitude of tasks that are needed for the
    continuity of research in a field, rather than just focusing on the number
    of research papers or citations. Since this reputation lives on the
    blockchain, anyone can see how the reputation was built, using what
    parameters, and from which projects.


    ## Reproducibility

    In traditional science, there is not much incentive to verify the process,
    mathematical models, data, and results of the research. There are some check
    and balancers, but no one invests time to reverify the details. In fields
    like Bio/Pharma, it is essential that the results are easily reproducible.
    In 2022, the world learned about the manipulated study on Alzheimer's. The
    study contained forged images of the results, and no one verified the
    research for more than a decade. Other researchers based their research on
    those results. The National Institution of Health paid hundreds of millions
    of dollars to projects that were either directly or indirectly based on that
    manipulated research. By adding new incentives and reputation, much focus
    can be made on the reproducibility and verification of the research.


    ## Communication and Collaboration

    Sometimes, it's the culture that brings in a shift, more than the technology
    itself. There are hundreds of tools available that help in collaboration
    based on a cause or a topic. These tools have been extensively used in
    Software Development teams or Blockchain teams. With DeSci, we see
    communities bringing in the same culture of openness and collaboration,
    enabling researchers, scientists, academicians, students, and industry
    experts to collaborate towards common causes.

    including time, funding, and expertise. Researchers need to ensure that they
    have the necessary resources to support collaboration and that resources are
    allocated appropriately to ensure that all collaborators can contribute
    effectively.


    ## Intellectual Property Ownership Issues

    Biopharma researchers may face several issues related to intellectual
    property (IP) ownership, including:


    Competing claims: Collaborating with other researchers or companies can
    create competing claims to IP ownership, particularly when multiple parties
    contribute to the development of a new drug or therapy. This can lead to
    legal disputes over who owns the IP and how it should be used.


    Lack of clarity: IP ownership can be unclear, particularly when
    collaborations involve multiple organizations or researchers with different
    levels of involvement. This can make it difficult to determine who has the
    right to use and license the IP, leading to delays in commercialization or
    disputes.


    Licensing issues: Biopharma researchers may face challenges in licensing
    their IP, particularly when dealing with complex licensing agreements or
    negotiating with multiple parties. Licensing issues can impact the ability
    to commercialize a drug or therapy, or lead to disputes over royalties or
    licensing fees.

    infringing on the IP rights of others, particularly when conducting research
    or developing new therapies. Infringement issues can lead to legal disputes
    or delays in commercialization.


    Patentability: Biopharma researchers need to ensure that their research and
    inventions are patentable, particularly when seeking patent protection for
    their IP. Patentability issues can impact the ability to license or
    commercialize the IP, or lead to disputes over patent rights.


    Regulatory compliance: Biopharma researchers need to ensure that their IP is
    compliant with all relevant regulations and guidelines, particularly when
    seeking approval for new drugs or therapies. Failure to comply with
    regulatory requirements can impact the ability to commercialize the IP or
    lead to legal disputes.


    International IP laws: Biopharma researchers may face challenges in
    navigating international IP laws and regulations, particularly when
    collaborating with researchers or companies in different countries or
    regions. Differences in IP laws and regulations can impact the ability to
    license or commercialize IP, or lead to disputes over ownership rights.


    ## Monetizing issues

    Biopharmaceutical companies face several challenges in monetizing their
    research efforts, including:


    Costly research and development: Biopharmaceutical research and development
    is a lengthy and expensive process that can take several years and require
    significant investment. The high cost of developing new drugs and treatments
    can make it challenging for companies to monetize their research.


    Competition: The biopharmaceutical industry is highly competitive, with many
    companies vying for the same market share. This competition can make it
    difficult for companies to monetize their research, as competitors may
    develop similar products or treatments that can be sold at a lower price.


    Regulatory hurdles: Biopharmaceutical products are subject to strict
    regulatory requirements, including clinical trials, safety testing, and
    approval by regulatory agencies such as the FDA. Meeting these requirements
    can be time-consuming and costly, making it challenging for companies to
    monetize their research.


    Intellectual property protection: Biopharmaceutical companies rely heavily
    on intellectual property protection to monetize their research. However, the
    patent process can be complex and lengthy, and there is always a risk that a
    competitor may develop a similar product or treatment that does not infringe
    on existing patents.


    Market access: Even after successfully developing a new drug or treatment,
    companies may face challenges in getting it to market. Factors such as
    pricing, reimbursement, and distribution can all affect the ability of
    companies to monetize their research.


    Overall, the biopharmaceutical industry faces a range of challenges in
    monetizing its research efforts, and companies must navigate these obstacles
    carefully to succeed in the market.


    ## Fundraising Issues

    fundraising for their research, including:


    High costs of research and development: Biopharmaceutical research and
    development can be expensive, and companies often require substantial
    funding to support their efforts. Investors may be hesitant to provide
    funding due to the long timeline and uncertain outcomes associated with drug
    development.


    Regulatory risks: There are significant regulatory risks associated with
    biopharmaceutical research, particularly with respect to clinical trials and
    FDA approval. Investors may be wary of these risks and hesitant to invest in
    a company that has not yet received regulatory approval for its products.


    Intellectual property risks: Biopharmaceutical research often relies heavily
    on intellectual property protection, including patents, to ensure a return
    on investment. However, there is always a risk that competitors may infringe
    on existing patents, reducing the value of the investment.


    Market competition: The biopharmaceutical industry is highly competitive,
    and companies must navigate a complex landscape of competitors and market
    pressures. Investors may be hesitant to provide funding if they perceive
    that the market for a particular drug or treatment is already saturated.


    Market access: Even after successfully developing a new drug or treatment,
    companies may face challenges in getting it to market due to factors such as
    pricing, reimbursement, and distribution. Investors may be hesitant to
    provide funding if they perceive that these factors will pose significant
    obstacles to the commercial success of the product.


    Overall, fundraising for biopharmaceutical research can be a complex and
    challenging process. Companies must carefully consider these factors and
    develop a compelling case for investment to attract the funding they need to
    support their research and development efforts.
