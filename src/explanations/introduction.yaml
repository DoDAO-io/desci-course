    > Decentralized science (DeSci) is a movement that aims to build public
    infrastructure for funding, creating, reviewing, crediting, storing, and
    disseminating scientific knowledge fairly and equitably using the Web3 stack
    â€“ Ethereum.org 


    There is a lot to unpack in this definition, with each term such as
    "funding, creating, reviewing, crediting, storing, and disseminating"
    requiring detailed explanation. Undoubtedly, science has played a major role
    in making the world a better place for humans than ever before. Private
    industry readily supports areas of innovation that promise short-term
    financial gains, while research in fields that lack direct monetary
    benefits, such as space exploration, bio research, and pollution control,
    rely heavily on government funding. Unfortunately, the outcomes of such
    research often prioritize theoretical publications over real-world impact.


    DeSci is an experimental field that takes cues from open-source software
    development, as well as DeFi and Decentralized Autonomous Organization
    concepts, to streamline and optimize the entire research process. By
    employing mechanisms such as public open grants, incentivized coordination,
    effort tracking, and reward distribution, DeSci aims to make research more
    efficient and effective.

    Traditional way of science has led to many great outcomes but over the years
    the entire process has deteriorated as it has not been able to keep up with
    the pace of technology. Many of the problems faced in the Traditional
    Science institutions are same as faced by government bodies and that is
    primarily because science and the decision making is has become very
    centralized. Also the focus has moved away from impact to more towards
    publishing research papers. Below we discuss some of the biggest problems
    that are faced in the current Traditional Science industry. 


    ## Funding

    Funding problems in science exist both in public and private sectors. The
    challenges faced in private sector by science startups is same or in fact
    more intense than other startup as the product turnaround time in science
    startups is quite longer and the investment needed for hardware or initial
    setup is also relatively quite high. Private VCs invest purely based on
    risk/reward and not based on the impact.   


    In the public space, the grant mechanisms that government entities use are
    often outdated and favour the veterans of the fields. Normally it is easier
    to get funding for newer initiatives, which means that the focus of the
    grantees is more towards wrapping up the existing project and then starting
    on a new initiative, rather than making sure that the current project has
    long term usefulness. 


    The way the grants are distributed are also biased, and its more of the
    field veterans giving grants to other veterans making it very difficult for
    new members to
