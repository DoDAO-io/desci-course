  details: >
    > Decentralized science (DeSci) is a movement that aims to build public
    infrastructure for funding, creating, reviewing, crediting, storing, and
    disseminating scientific knowledge fairly and equitably using the Web3 stack
    – Ethereum.org 


    There is a lot to unpack in this definition, with each term such as
    "funding, creating, reviewing, crediting, storing, and disseminating"
    requiring detailed explanation. Undoubtedly, science has played a major role
    in making the world a better place for humans than ever before. Private
    industry readily supports areas of innovation that promise short-term
    financial gains, while research in fields that lack direct monetary
    benefits, such as space exploration, bio research, and pollution control,
    rely heavily on government funding. Unfortunately, the outcomes of such
    research often prioritize theoretical publications over real-world impact.


    DeSci is an experimental field that takes cues from open-source software
    development, as well as DeFi and Decentralized Autonomous Organization
    concepts, to streamline and optimize the entire research process. By
    employing mechanisms such as public open grants, incentivized coordination,
    effort tracking, and reward distribution, DeSci aims to make research more
    efficient and effective.


    Although DeSci concepts can be applied in any sector, there has been a
    notable increase in the adoption of decentralized concepts and primitives
    within the field of biomedical science. Therefore, this course will
    specifically concentrate on the implementation of DeSci in the biomedical
    science domain.

    While the traditional approach to science has led to numerous advancements,
    it has not kept pace with technological advancements, resulting in a
    deteriorating process. Similar to government bodies, science institutions
    also face several issues, primarily due to centralization of
    decision-making. Additionally, the focus has shifted from making an impact
    to publishing research papers. Some of the most significant problems
    currently faced by the traditional science industry are discussed below.


    ## Funding

    Funding problems plague both the public and private sectors in science.
    Science startups face more intense funding challenges than other startups as
    their product turnaround time is longer, and initial setup costs are higher.
    Private VCs invest based solely on risk/reward and not impact.


    In the public sector, the grant mechanisms used by government entities are
    outdated and favor field veterans. It is easier to obtain funding for newer
    initiatives, which means grantees focus on completing current projects and
    starting new ones rather than ensuring long-term usefulness of current
    projects. Grant distribution is also biased, with veterans giving grants to
    other veterans, making it challenging for new members to secure funding.


    ## Relevance

    Most research done by PhDs is buried in research papers, and the focus is
    solely on publishing rather than applicability of research. Academic
    institutions have minimum publication requirements for tenured positions.
    After research is published, academics do not make an effort to ensure the
    industry is aware of it or that others can use their research.


    Furthermore, many researchers prioritize using checklists for methods
    applicability, data availability, and result derivability, rather than
    focusing on novelty of topics or ideas. Newer areas have relatively less
    literature or data available, making it challenging to apply existing models
    or methods, which discourages working on the latest trends.


    ## Research Collaboration

    Traditionally, academic and scientific research has been conducted in
    isolation, with little effort made to build upon the work of others or to
    facilitate collaboration. However, with the advent of modern coordination
    mechanisms, such as those used in open-source software projects, it is now
    possible for researchers to work together in a more transparent and
    efficient manner. These projects allow for open collaboration and provide
    easy access to project resources, enabling new team members to quickly get
    up to speed with the project.


    ## Intellectual Property Ownership

    Intellectual property (IP) refers to legal rights granted to inventors and
    creators, such as patents, copyrights, and trademarks. However, the rules
    for IP ownership and transfer can vary significantly between research
    institutions. In many cases, the IP produced by researchers is not easily
    transferable or awarded in a flexible manner that reflects the contributions
    of team members.


    ## Reward Distribution

    Despite the potential market value of the IP produced, there is often a lack
    of reward structures in place for researchers. This can lead to a shift in
    focus from the research itself to obtaining a tenured position.
    Additionally, there is often no clear or flexible way to distribute rewards
    based on individual contributions to the project.

    DeFi has the potential to address many of the problems we discussed earlier,
    and DeSci, while still experimental, has garnered a lot of attention. There
    are real-world projects targeting these areas and making significant
    progress. Our focus is to learn from the new primitives and projects in
    order to determine what we can borrow and apply in our own project or
    situation. Let's explore the benefits provided by DeSci.


    ## Assistance with Funding

    As we previously mentioned, it is easy to raise funds in a transparent
    manner using DeFi primitives like Bonding Curves and Liquidity Bootstrapping
    Pools. In DeSci, even more innovative formats are being used for funding.
    Communities or Decentralized Autonomous Organizations are formed around
    causes such as Longevity, Psychedelics, and Hair Loss. These communities
    have their own tokens that help create a treasury, and members vote to
    select the projects or researchers to fund. Even traditional pharma players
    are participating in these models. For example, VitaDAO, a DAO focused on
    raising funds for research on extending human life, closed a $4.1 million
    funding round with Pfizer Ventures and several others.


    ## Flexible Intellectual Property Ownership

    DeSci uses Ethereum's ERC-20 tokens and ERC-721 NFT standards to represent
    intellectual property on the blockchain. Molecule has developed an "IP-NFT"
    as an Intellectual Property primitive. These IP-NFTs connect IP and research
    data rights to NFTs using legal contracts attached to smart contracts. They
    represent a new paradigm in legal contracts for scientific research and are
    stored on Ethereum. IP-NFTs can be transferred, used in DeFi,
    fractionalized, and enable crowd control of ethics in commercialization.
    They also bring unprecedented liquidity to IP markets.


    ## Reputation instead of Citation

    DeFi and blockchain are currently experimenting with many reputation
    primitives like badges, soulbound tokens, and non-transferrable tokens,
    which can be used to encourage a multitude of tasks that are needed for the
    continuity of research in a field, rather than just focusing on the number
    of research papers or citations. Since this reputation lives on the
    blockchain, anyone can see how the reputation was built, using what
    parameters, and from which projects.


    ## Reproducibility

    In traditional science, there is not much incentive to verify the process,
    mathematical models, data, and results of the research. There are some check
    and balancers, but no one invests time to reverify the details. In fields
    like Bio/Pharma, it is essential that the results are easily reproducible.
    In 2022, the world learned about the manipulated study on Alzheimer's. The
    study contained forged images of the results, and no one verified the
    research for more than a decade. Other researchers based their research on
    those results. The National Institution of Health paid hundreds of millions
    of dollars to projects that were either directly or indirectly based on that
    manipulated research. By adding new incentives and reputation, much focus
    can be made on the reproducibility and verification of the research.


    ## Communication and Collaboration

    Sometimes, it's the culture that brings in a shift, more than the technology
    itself. There are hundreds of tools available that help in collaboration
    based on a cause or a topic. These tools have been extensively used in
    Software Development teams or Blockchain teams. With DeSci, we see
    communities bringing in the same culture of openness and collaboration,
    enabling researchers, scientists, academicians, students, and industry
    experts to collaborate towards common causes.

    The Relationship between Faculty Researchers and Technology Transfer Offices
    (TTOs)


    Faculty researchers sometimes choose not to disclose their research results
    to their TTOs due to conflicts with their tenure and promotion policies,
    publication delays, and hindering their professional growth. Additionally,
    faculty researchers may resent TTO staff who engage in unethical behavior,
    such as favoritism in patenting and marketing faculty inventions. TTOs may
    also be resented when their service expectations are not met, or when no or
    inadequate IP training or outreach is provided.


    Faculty researchers who consider themselves ivory tower purists may have
    disdain for TTO staff and commercialization in general. They may not want
    TTO deals with industry partners to dictate their research direction and
    decisions about what research the university will support. Purists believe
    that industry scientists are secretive and driven to patent and
    commercialize, and that university researchers should be more transparent.
    However, it has been demonstrated that they both share or do not share for
    various reasons, and academics' perception of industrial science is biased.


    Public disputes between faculty and their universities have arisen, causing
    an important ethical question of whether it is ethical to retaliate against
    whistleblowers. Whistleblowing is the act of exposing wrongdoing by
    reporting it internally to an organization's management or externally.
    External disclosures are often deemed disloyal, and internal disclosures are
    favored because they give an organization an opportunity to take corrective
    action before being exposed externally. Yet, when an organization retaliates
    against a whistleblower, it is retaliating against itself.


    Organizations need clear ethical behavior standards, supported by their
    leadership, to prevent, detect, and correct wrongdoing. Moreover, faculty
    researchers have clashed with TTO staff, who help them found a spin-off
    business and hire a CEO, but they disagree with the CEO, leading to their
    removal from the company's board.


    The examples illustrate the complex relationship between faculty researchers
    and TTOs, and the need for a clear understanding of the expectations,
    ethical standards, and guidelines to prevent conflicts.


    ----


    Within universities, conflicts of interest, and commitments are managed

    by research compliance officers. These conflicts reflect circumstances that

    create a risk that a professional’s judgment and subsequent actions related

    to a primary interest will be unduly influenced by a secondary interest.

    Non-financial conflicts, such as biases in reviews of applications for
    grants

    or in peer review publications, are difficult to detect and prove (Beyer &

    Czernin, 2010). This is also true with regard to TTO staff’s review of
    invention disclosures for patentability and marketability. Since revenue
    generation is an important performance measure, TTOs may favor the low

    hanging fruit such as those inventions with large commercial market appeal

    and a small number of faculty with proven track records (Rasor & Heller,

    2006). Focusing on landing a blockbuster may alienate research faculty who
    feel their invention disclosures receive curt, unsympathetic treatment.

    It fosters IP leakage and uncooperative behaviors by faculty researchers

    toward TTOs (Owen-Smith & Powell, 2001). Such inequitable behaviors on

    the part of the TTO staff are unethical as they deliberately conflict with
    the

    research university’s mission to develop, reinforce, and support “all”

    research faculty in good standing, not just those that they may financially

    benefit from the most. Indeed, today, in a competitive metric-driven
    academic environment (e.g., total federal grant funding), it becomes easy to

    overlook certain faculty who need these services but aren’t ready to deliver

    the blockbuster invention. In a sense, competitive metrics may be trumping

    ethical behavior. This should be a concern for all of us in academia.

    As inferred in the above paragraph, a further examples of conflict occur

    when TTO staff are called upon to make exceptions to university policies in

    order to foster a large deal (Nelsen, 2007). These deals could include
    industry-sponsored grants, sponsored chairs, retention of a faculty
    researchers,

    or recruitment of an identified faculty researcher. A 2013 Canadian

    Association of University Teachers (CAUT) ethics report of an examination of
    12 universities across Canada, raised concerns about the University

    of British Columbia’s $9 million deal with Pfizer which bound the university
    to the Pfizer’s interests (Munro, 2013). The report furthermore stated

    that 10 of the 12 universities received failing ethics grades because of
    closed

    door deals that violated the Canadian’s policy for complete transparency.

    Bok (2003) blames university presidents for wrongdoings since the presidents
    are charged with protecting the university’s core values. Bok recommends
    that when seeking to protect a university’s core values from the

    pitfalls of commercialization, the university should not rely on their
    presidents who are under enormous pressure to find money and to balance
    budgets. For example, in the 1980s, given an eroding technological

    manufacturing base, American universities were increasingly under pressure

    from both industry and government to contribute more to economic development
    and to develop economically viable technology (Lee & Gaertner,

    1994). To this end, the University of Michigan was affectionately called

    Michigan, Inc. because its leaders pressed their academic colleges,
    institutes, faculty, and staff to identify and develop new markets that
    would offset revenue shortfalls (Zemsky, 2003). Presidents typically
    delegate to their

    Vice Presidents of Research, who may be charged with TTO duties or may

    delegate to a TTO staff (Siegel et al., 2004). Bok advocates that university

    leaders should not engage in one-offs and should not engage in the practice

    of considering commercial opportunities on a case-by-case basis (Bok,

    2003). Instead, university leaders should promulgate and enforce general
    rules related to corporate-research agreements and conflicts of interests
    for

    scientists. The problem with this solution is that, as noted by Nelsen

    (2007), universities have general rules and policies that get ignored by TTO

    staff when exceptions are made.

    Recommendation 2: TTO staff should be required to demonstrate to

    their university leaders and university research foundation administrators

    that they are providing an equitable distribution of services and financial

    investments campus wide; and if not, they need to explain why they can’t.

    Recommendation 3: TTO staff should be required to demonstrate to

    their university leaders and university research foundation administrators

    that they have not violated any standing rules or policies when making the

    decision to patent and/or license inventions created with university

    resources; and if not, they need to explain why they can’t. There needs to

    be total transparency and accountability for their actions.

    Publish or perish: One of the primary reasons that faculty researchers are

    tempted to lose their virtue and choose to unethically violate university
    policy is the mere potential threat of having a publication delay.
    Publication

    delays can reduce a faculty member’s chances for earning tenure, and is

    enough to prevent a faculty member from remaining virtuous. Indeed, it

    leads to significant job insecurity.

    Research universities increased their engagement in technology transfer

    with the passage of the Bayh Dole Act of 1980 (Rogers, 2000). The Bayh

    Dole Act allows universities to license and sell technology created with
    federal funds. TTO staff members are charged with enforcing university
    policies that typically require faculty to divulge their inventions using
    invention

    disclosure forms. Faculty researchers are required to wait to publish their

    findings until the TTO staff conducts an evaluation of the invention for

    patentability and marketability. There are complaints by faculty that the

    evaluation process takes too long (Swamidass & Vulasa, 2009). Faculty

    may be anxious to disseminate their findings and some may want to

    actively commercialize their potentially profitable products themselves

    (Capelli, 2006; Elmer & McKinney, 2012; Litan & Lesa, 2010; Litan, Lesa, &

    Reedy, 2007a; Sanberg et al., 2014). Inventions created using university

    resources are often deemed university owned IP according to university
    policies. University resources can include, but are not limited to, use of
    university

    equipment, office and lab spaces, labor (i.e., doing research on university

    time). Failure to disclose inventions created with university resources is

    deemed unethical as it directly violates university policies.

    Significant delays in the university technology transfer offices’ evaluation

    of faculty researcher’s invention disclosure can thwart opportunities for
    faculty researchers to publish their research findings in a timely manner.

    When faculty do not submit their invention disclosures and risk violating

    university policy to avoid the risk of publication delays (Bercovitz &

    Feldman, 2003; Cao et al., 2015; Litan, Lesa, & Reedy, 2007b), they can

    be accused of taking university inventions “out the back door.” In fact,

    almost 30% of university inventions are estimated to be commercialized in

    this manner (Heitner & Grant, 2010).

    Universities want to commercialize discoveries from their labs more

    swiftly (Schramm, 2004). Promising university creations are often stuck,

    mired in the depths of bureaucracy, the lack of applied TTO skills, and
    limited resources. Efforts made by TTO staff to increase awareness and to
    simplify administrative processes may encourage invention disclosures and

    patent applications, but they do little for licensing. Licensing requires
    institutional capacity and resources to understand and react to market

    dynamics, commercial opportunities, and diverse interests of industry (Wu,

    Welch, & Huang, 2014). Thus, the reality is that many promising research

    findings consistently fail to be developed and brought to market for
    practical use. In the end, more must be done to rapidly and efficiently move
    technology from research universities into the commercial market place

    (Schramm, 2004).
