  shortTitle: What is DeSci
  details: >
    > Decentralized science (DeSci) is a movement that aims to build public
    infrastructure for funding, creating, reviewing, crediting, storing, and
    disseminating scientific knowledge fairly and equitably using the Web3 stack
    â€“ Ethereum.org 


    There is a lot to unpack in this definition, with each term such as
    "funding, creating, reviewing, crediting, storing, and disseminating"
    requiring detailed explanation. Undoubtedly, science has played a major role
    in making the world a better place for humans than ever before. Private
    industry readily supports areas of innovation that promise short-term
    financial gains, while research in fields that lack direct monetary
    benefits, such as space exploration, bio research, and pollution control,
    rely heavily on government funding. Unfortunately, the outcomes of such
    research often prioritize theoretical publications over real-world impact.


    DeSci is an experimental field that takes cues from open-source software
    development, as well as DeFi and Decentralized Autonomous Organization
    concepts, to streamline and optimize the entire research process. By
    employing mechanisms such as public open grants, incentivized coordination,
    effort tracking, and reward distribution, DeSci aims to make research more
    efficient and effective.


    Although DeSci concepts can be applied in any sector, there has been a
    notable increase in the adoption of decentralized concepts and primitives
    within the field of biopharma. Therefore, this course will specifically
    concentrate on the implementation of DeSci in the biopharma science domain.

    The traditional approach to science has not kept pace with technological
    advancements, and science institutions face several issues due to
    centralization of decision-making. Some of the significant problems include
    issues with technology transfer offices, commercialization, funding,
    collaboration, and relevance. These issues affect biopharma researchers'
    ability to bring new drugs and therapies to market, secure funding,
    collaborate effectively, and ensure the industry is aware of their research.
    Let's discuss these issues in detail


    ## Issues with Technology Transfer Offices (TTOs)

    The transfer of technology from academia to the market is a vital function
    carried out by Technology Transfer Offices (TTOs), enabling scientific
    research to be translated into tangible products and services that benefit
    society. Nonetheless, TTOs and researchers are confronted with numerous
    challenges, including conflicts with tenure and promotion policies, limited
    resources, complex legal and regulatory requirements, and difficulties in
    identifying potential commercial partners.


    TTOs outside of the top universities often encounter issues due to limited
    budgets and expertise, including intellectual property management,
    commercialization and licensing, funding and budget constraints, legal and
    regulatory compliance, collaboration and partnerships, and a limited
    understanding of business and entrepreneurship. Furthermore, cultural
    disparities and language barriers can pose difficulties for researchers
    operating across multiple countries and regions.


    ## Commercialization

    The commercialization of biopharmaceutical research is an arduous process
    due to various challenges such as regulatory barriers, concerns surrounding
    intellectual property, and the high costs associated with drug development.
    The regulatory process is both time-consuming and expensive, often requiring
    researchers to conduct multiple clinical trials before their drug can be
    approved for commercialization. Keeping up with the evolving regulatory
    landscape is crucial to ensure compliance.


    Drug development is a risky and potentially lucrative venture, with high
    failure rates. Only a small percentage of compounds that undergo development
    are ultimately approved for market, and those that do often come with a
    hefty price tag. Given these complex processes, many biopharmaceutical
    researchers are hesitant to pursue commercialization. However, it is only
    through commercialization and mass production that drugs can become widely
    accessible to patients. Unfortunately, much research is left unpublished and
    not pursued for commercialization, denying patients the benefits of new
    discoveries.


    ## Funding 

    Bringing a new drug or therapy to market in the biopharmaceutical industry
    typically requires a substantial amount of funding to cover expenses such as
    clinical trials, regulatory approvals, and manufacturing. However, due to
    the high level of risk involved, investors may be reluctant to invest in
    biopharma research, resulting in a lack of funding for promising research
    projects.


    Moreover, research projects focused on rare diseases or conditions may
    struggle to secure sufficient funding, as they may not have a large enough
    market to be financially viable. These challenges make it difficult for
    biopharma researchers to obtain the necessary funding to bring their
    research to fruition.


    In the public sector, government grant mechanisms are outdated and tend to
    favor established researchers, making it easier for them to secure funding
    for new initiatives. Consequently, grantees often prioritize completing
    current projects and starting new ones over ensuring the long-term
    effectiveness of existing projects. Additionally, there is a bias in grant
    distribution, as veteran researchers often prefer to grant funding to other
    veterans, making it challenging for new researchers to obtain funding.



    ## Collaboration Issues

    Collaboration can be a challenging prospect for biopharma researchers due to
    several obstacles. One of the primary hurdles is the highly competitive
    nature of the industry, which can discourage companies from collaborating
    with rivals and sharing critical resources, including patient data or
    specialized equipment.


    Another significant challenge is the lack of standardization in data and
    research protocols. Biopharma researchers frequently use varying methods for
    collecting and analyzing data, making it difficult to compare study results.
    This issue can be particularly problematic when attempting to reproduce
    study outcomes, a crucial step in the drug development process. Moreover,
    regulatory agencies may impose different clinical trial and data collection
    requirements, further complicating the collaboration process.



    ## Relevance

    Most research done by PhDs is buried in research papers, and the focus is
    solely on publishing rather than applicability of research. Academic
    institutions have minimum publication requirements for tenured positions.
    After research is published, academics do not make an effort to ensure the
    industry is aware of it or that others can use their research.


    Furthermore, many researchers prioritize using checklists for methods
    applicability, data availability, and result derivability, rather than
    focusing on novelty of topics or ideas. Newer areas have relatively less
    literature or data available, making it challenging to apply existing models
    or methods, which discourages working on the latest trends.


    ## Intellectual Property Ownership

    One of the significant challenges facing biopharmaceutical researchers is
    protecting the intellectual property associated with their products. The
    patent process for biopharmaceuticals is complicated, time-consuming, and
    expensive, and infringement of existing patents can result in costly legal
    battles, delaying the introduction of new products to market. Researchers
    must navigate the complex landscape of existing IP rights while ensuring
    that their innovations do not infringe on other patents.


    ## Reward Distribution

    Despite the potential market value of the IP produced, there is often a lack
    of reward structures in place for researchers. This can lead to a shift in
    focus from the research itself to obtaining a tenured position.
    Additionally, there is often no clear or flexible way to distribute rewards
    based on individual contributions to the project.

    DeFi has the potential to address many of the problems we discussed earlier,
    and DeSci, while still experimental, has garnered a lot of attention. There
    are real-world projects targeting these areas and making significant
    progress. Our focus is to learn from the new primitives and projects in
    order to determine what we can borrow and apply in our own project or
    situation. Let's explore the benefits provided by DeSci.


    ## Assistance with Funding

    As we previously mentioned, it is easy to raise funds in a transparent
    manner using DeFi primitives like Bonding Curves and Liquidity Bootstrapping
    Pools. In DeSci, even more innovative formats are being used for funding.
    Communities or Decentralized Autonomous Organizations are formed around
    causes such as Longevity, Psychedelics, and Hair Loss. These communities
    have their own tokens that help create a treasury, and members vote to
    select the projects or researchers to fund. Even traditional pharma players
    are participating in these models. For example, VitaDAO, a DAO focused on
    raising funds for research on extending human life, closed a $4.1 million
    funding round with Pfizer Ventures and several others.


    ## Flexible Intellectual Property Ownership

    DeSci uses Ethereum's ERC-20 tokens and ERC-721 NFT standards to represent
    intellectual property on the blockchain. Molecule has developed an "IP-NFT"
    as an Intellectual Property primitive. These IP-NFTs connect IP and research
    data rights to NFTs using legal contracts attached to smart contracts. They
    represent a new paradigm in legal contracts for scientific research and are
    stored on Ethereum. IP-NFTs can be transferred, used in DeFi,
    fractionalized, and enable crowd control of ethics in commercialization.
    They also bring unprecedented liquidity to IP markets.


    ## Reputation instead of Citation

    DeFi and blockchain are currently experimenting with many reputation
    primitives like badges, soulbound tokens, and non-transferrable tokens,
    which can be used to encourage a multitude of tasks that are needed for the
    continuity of research in a field, rather than just focusing on the number
    of research papers or citations. Since this reputation lives on the
    blockchain, anyone can see how the reputation was built, using what
    parameters, and from which projects.


    ## Reproducibility

    In traditional science, there is not much incentive to verify the process,
    mathematical models, data, and results of the research. There are some check
    and balancers, but no one invests time to reverify the details. In fields
    like Bio/Pharma, it is essential that the results are easily reproducible.
    In 2022, the world learned about the manipulated study on Alzheimer's. The
    study contained forged images of the results, and no one verified the
    research for more than a decade. Other researchers based their research on
    those results. The National Institution of Health paid hundreds of millions
    of dollars to projects that were either directly or indirectly based on that
    manipulated research. By adding new incentives and reputation, much focus
    can be made on the reproducibility and verification of the research.


    ## Communication and Collaboration

    Sometimes, it's the culture that brings in a shift, more than the technology
    itself. There are hundreds of tools available that help in collaboration
    based on a cause or a topic. These tools have been extensively used in
    Software Development teams or Blockchain teams. With DeSci, we see
    communities bringing in the same culture of openness and collaboration,
    enabling researchers, scientists, academicians, students, and industry
    experts to collaborate towards common causes.
