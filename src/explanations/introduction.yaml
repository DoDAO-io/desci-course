  shortTitle: What is DeSci
  details: >
    > Decentralized science (DeSci) is a movement that aims to build public
    infrastructure for funding, creating, reviewing, crediting, storing, and
    disseminating scientific knowledge fairly and equitably using the Web3 stack
    â€“ Ethereum.org 


    There is a lot to unpack in this definition, with each term such as
    "funding, creating, reviewing, crediting, storing, and disseminating"
    requiring detailed explanation. Undoubtedly, science has played a major role
    in making the world a better place for humans than ever before. Private
    industry readily supports areas of innovation that promise short-term
    financial gains, while research in fields that lack direct monetary
    benefits, such as space exploration, bio research, and pollution control,
    rely heavily on government funding. Unfortunately, the outcomes of such
    research often prioritize theoretical publications over real-world impact.


    DeSci is an experimental field that takes cues from open-source software
    development, as well as DeFi and Decentralized Autonomous Organization
    concepts, to streamline and optimize the entire research process. By
    employing mechanisms such as public open grants, incentivized coordination,
    effort tracking, and reward distribution, DeSci aims to make research more
    efficient and effective.


    Although DeSci concepts can be applied in any sector, there has been a
    notable increase in the adoption of decentralized concepts and primitives
    within the field of biopharma. Therefore, this course will specifically
    concentrate on the implementation of DeSci in the biopharma science domain.

    While the traditional approach to science has led to numerous advancements,
    it has not kept pace with technological advancements, resulting in a
    deteriorating process. Similar to government bodies, science institutions
    also face several issues, primarily due to centralization of
    decision-making. Additionally, the focus has shifted from making an impact
    to publishing research papers. Some of the most significant problems
    currently faced by the traditional science industry are discussed below.


    ## Funding

    Funding problems plague both the public and private sectors in science.
    Science startups face more intense funding challenges than other startups as
    their product turnaround time is longer, and initial setup costs are higher.
    Private VCs invest based solely on risk/reward and not impact.


    In the public sector, the grant mechanisms used by government entities are
    outdated and favor field veterans. It is easier to obtain funding for newer
    initiatives, which means grantees focus on completing current projects and
    starting new ones rather than ensuring long-term usefulness of current
    projects. Grant distribution is also biased, with veterans giving grants to
    other veterans, making it challenging for new members to secure funding.


    ## Relevance

    Most research done by PhDs is buried in research papers, and the focus is
    solely on publishing rather than applicability of research. Academic
    institutions have minimum publication requirements for tenured positions.
    After research is published, academics do not make an effort to ensure the
    industry is aware of it or that others can use their research.


    Furthermore, many researchers prioritize using checklists for methods
    applicability, data availability, and result derivability, rather than
    focusing on novelty of topics or ideas. Newer areas have relatively less
    literature or data available, making it challenging to apply existing models
    or methods, which discourages working on the latest trends.


    ## Research Collaboration

    Traditionally, academic and scientific research has been conducted in
    isolation, with little effort made to build upon the work of others or to
    facilitate collaboration. However, with the advent of modern coordination
    mechanisms, such as those used in open-source software projects, it is now
    possible for researchers to work together in a more transparent and
    efficient manner. These projects allow for open collaboration and provide
    easy access to project resources, enabling new team members to quickly get
    up to speed with the project.


    ## Intellectual Property Ownership

    Intellectual property (IP) refers to legal rights granted to inventors and
    creators, such as patents, copyrights, and trademarks. However, the rules
    for IP ownership and transfer can vary significantly between research
    institutions. In many cases, the IP produced by researchers is not easily
    transferable or awarded in a flexible manner that reflects the contributions
    of team members.


    ## Reward Distribution

    Despite the potential market value of the IP produced, there is often a lack
    of reward structures in place for researchers. This can lead to a shift in
    focus from the research itself to obtaining a tenured position.
    Additionally, there is often no clear or flexible way to distribute rewards
    based on individual contributions to the project.

    DeFi has the potential to address many of the problems we discussed earlier,
    and DeSci, while still experimental, has garnered a lot of attention. There
    are real-world projects targeting these areas and making significant
    progress. Our focus is to learn from the new primitives and projects in
    order to determine what we can borrow and apply in our own project or
    situation. Let's explore the benefits provided by DeSci.


    ## Assistance with Funding

    As we previously mentioned, it is easy to raise funds in a transparent
    manner using DeFi primitives like Bonding Curves and Liquidity Bootstrapping
    Pools. In DeSci, even more innovative formats are being used for funding.
    Communities or Decentralized Autonomous Organizations are formed around
    causes such as Longevity, Psychedelics, and Hair Loss. These communities
    have their own tokens that help create a treasury, and members vote to
    select the projects or researchers to fund. Even traditional pharma players
    are participating in these models. For example, VitaDAO, a DAO focused on
    raising funds for research on extending human life, closed a $4.1 million
    funding round with Pfizer Ventures and several others.


    ## Flexible Intellectual Property Ownership

    DeSci uses Ethereum's ERC-20 tokens and ERC-721 NFT standards to represent
    intellectual property on the blockchain. Molecule has developed an "IP-NFT"
    as an Intellectual Property primitive. These IP-NFTs connect IP and research
    data rights to NFTs using legal contracts attached to smart contracts. They
    represent a new paradigm in legal contracts for scientific research and are
    stored on Ethereum. IP-NFTs can be transferred, used in DeFi,
    fractionalized, and enable crowd control of ethics in commercialization.
    They also bring unprecedented liquidity to IP markets.


    ## Reputation instead of Citation

    DeFi and blockchain are currently experimenting with many reputation
    primitives like badges, soulbound tokens, and non-transferrable tokens,
    which can be used to encourage a multitude of tasks that are needed for the
    continuity of research in a field, rather than just focusing on the number
    of research papers or citations. Since this reputation lives on the
    blockchain, anyone can see how the reputation was built, using what
    parameters, and from which projects.


    ## Reproducibility

    In traditional science, there is not much incentive to verify the process,
    mathematical models, data, and results of the research. There are some check
    and balancers, but no one invests time to reverify the details. In fields
    like Bio/Pharma, it is essential that the results are easily reproducible.
    In 2022, the world learned about the manipulated study on Alzheimer's. The
    study contained forged images of the results, and no one verified the
    research for more than a decade. Other researchers based their research on
    those results. The National Institution of Health paid hundreds of millions
    of dollars to projects that were either directly or indirectly based on that
    manipulated research. By adding new incentives and reputation, much focus
    can be made on the reproducibility and verification of the research.


    ## Communication and Collaboration

    Sometimes, it's the culture that brings in a shift, more than the technology
    itself. There are hundreds of tools available that help in collaboration
    based on a cause or a topic. These tools have been extensively used in
    Software Development teams or Blockchain teams. With DeSci, we see
    communities bringing in the same culture of openness and collaboration,
    enabling researchers, scientists, academicians, students, and industry
    experts to collaborate towards common causes.

  title: Issues with TTO
  shortTitle: Tech transfer issues
  details: >-
    1. Faculty researchers may not disclose research results to TTOs due to
    conflicts with tenure and promotion policies, publication delays, and
    hindering professional growth.

    2. TTO staff engaging in unethical behavior can lead to resentment from
    faculty researchers.

    3. Faculty researchers who are ivory tower purists may have disdain for TTO
    staff and commercialization.

    4. Public disputes between faculty and universities have arisen, leading to
    ethical questions of retaliation against whistleblowers.

    5. Clear ethical behavior standards are needed to prevent conflicts of
    interest.

    6. TTOs may favor certain faculty members and inventions, leading to
    inequitable treatment.

    7. The pressure to publish, earn tenure, and commercialize products can lead
    to faculty researchers unethically violating university policies.


    ## Issues


    Technology transfer offices (TTOs) play an important role in helping to
    translate scientific research into practical applications and products that
    can benefit society. However, researchers from TTOs often face a range of
    challenges and issues, including:


    1. Limited resources: TTOs often have limited resources, including staff,
    funding, and time. This can make it difficult for researchers to adequately
    support and manage the technology transfer process, which can involve a lot
    of legal and administrative work.

    2. Complex legal and regulatory requirements: Technology transfer involves
    complex legal and regulatory requirements, such as intellectual property
    laws and licensing agreements. Researchers may find it challenging to
    navigate these requirements, which can vary depending on the country,
    region, or institution.

    3. Difficulty in identifying potential commercial partners: Researchers from
    TTOs may struggle to identify potential commercial partners, particularly if
    the technology they are working on is highly specialized or niche. This can
    make it difficult to find companies or investors who are interested in
    investing in or licensing the technology.

    4. Lack of understanding of industry needs: Researchers may also struggle to
    understand the needs of the industry and how their research can be applied
    to solve real-world problems. This can make it challenging to develop
    technologies that are relevant and useful to commercial partners.

    5. Time constraints: TTOs often work under tight deadlines to bring
    technologies to market, which can put pressure on researchers to deliver
    results quickly. This can make it difficult to conduct thorough research and
    testing, which can be critical to the success of the technology transfer
    process.


    Overall, technology transfer can be a complex and challenging process, and
    researchers from TTOs face a range of issues and obstacles in their work.
    However, with the right resources, support, and expertise, TTOs can help to
    bridge the gap between scientific research and commercial application, and
    drive innovation and economic growth.


    ## Issues 1

    Researchers from technology transfer offices may face several issues,
    including:


    Intellectual property management: Researchers need to understand the various
    aspects of intellectual property (IP) and manage it properly, including
    filing patents, copyrights, and trademarks. However, this can be a complex
    and time-consuming process, and mistakes can be costly.


    Commercialization and licensing: Researchers need to identify potential
    commercial applications of their research and find licensees or investors to
    help bring their ideas to market. However, this can be challenging,
    especially when dealing with complex technologies or niche markets.


    Funding and budget constraints: Technology transfer offices often have
    limited resources, and researchers may struggle to secure funding for their
    projects or find ways to keep costs down while still advancing their work.


    Legal and regulatory issues: Researchers may encounter legal or regulatory
    hurdles when trying to commercialize their research, such as compliance with
    FDA regulations, privacy laws, or environmental regulations.


    Collaboration and partnerships: Researchers need to build partnerships and
    collaborations with industry and other stakeholders to help bring their
    ideas to market. However, this can be difficult, especially if there are
    competing interests or concerns about intellectual property ownership.


    Limited knowledge of business and entrepreneurship: Researchers may not have
    the necessary business or entrepreneurial skills to effectively
    commercialize their research, and may require additional support and
    training to develop these skills.


    Cultural differences: Technology transfer offices may work across multiple
    countries and cultures, and researchers may need to navigate cultural
    differences and language barriers to effectively collaborate with partners
    in other regions.


    ## Commercialization issues

    Biopharma researchers face several issues related to commercialization,
    including:


    Intellectual Property (IP) management: Biopharma researchers must understand
    the various aspects of IP and protect it properly, including filing patents,
    copyrights, and trademarks. However, this can be a complex and expensive
    process, and mistakes can be costly.


    Regulatory hurdles: Biopharma researchers must navigate the complex and
    ever-changing regulatory landscape to get their products to market,
    including compliance with FDA regulations and other global regulatory
    bodies.


    Commercial viability: Biopharma researchers must consider the commercial
    viability of their products, including the size of the target market, the
    competitive landscape, and pricing strategies.


    Funding: Biopharma research is capital-intensive, and researchers must
    secure funding to advance their research and bring their products to market.
    However, funding can be difficult to obtain, particularly for early-stage
    research.


    Clinical trial design: Biopharma researchers must design clinical trials
    that are rigorous and effective at demonstrating the safety and efficacy of
    their products. Poorly designed trials can lead to delays in product
    approval or rejection by regulatory agencies.


    Manufacturing and supply chain: Biopharma researchers must consider the
    manufacturing and supply chain implications of their products, including
    scalability, cost, and quality control.


    Collaboration and partnerships: Biopharma researchers must build
    partnerships and collaborations with industry, academia, and other
    stakeholders to advance their research and bring their products to market.
    However, this can be challenging, particularly when there are competing
    interests or concerns about intellectual property ownership.


    ## Collaboration Issues


    Biopharma researchers may face several collaboration-related issues,
    including:


    Intellectual property (IP) ownership: Collaborating with other researchers
    or companies can create IP ownership issues, particularly when there are
    competing claims or different interpretations of ownership rights. This can
    be particularly challenging when collaborating across different countries or
    regions, each with its own IP laws and regulations.


    Data sharing: Biopharma researchers need to share data with collaborators to
    facilitate collaboration and advance research. However, there can be
    challenges around sharing data, particularly when dealing with sensitive
    patient information or proprietary research data. Data-sharing agreements
    and protocols can help ensure that data is shared appropriately and that
    collaborators are not put at risk.


    Communication and coordination: Collaborating across different
    organizations, regions, and time zones can create communication and
    coordination challenges, particularly when working on complex research
    projects. Effective communication strategies and tools, such as regular
    meetings, clear project goals and timelines, and shared project management
    tools, can help ensure that collaboration runs smoothly.


    Conflict of interest: Collaborations may create conflicts of interest,
    particularly when collaborating with industry partners. Researchers need to
    be transparent about any conflicts of interest and ensure that
    collaborations are structured in a way that supports their research goals
    and objectives.


    Regulatory compliance: Collaborating with partners in different countries or
    regions can create regulatory compliance issues, particularly when dealing
    with different regulatory regimes or requirements. Researchers need to
    ensure that they are compliant with all relevant regulations and guidelines,
    and that collaborations are structured in a way that supports compliance.


    Trust and relationships: Collaborating successfully requires trust and good
    relationships between collaborators. Researchers need to invest time and
    effort in building relationships with collaborators and ensuring that they
    are working towards shared goals and objectives.


    Resource allocation: Collaborations may require significant resources,
    including time, funding, and expertise. Researchers need to ensure that they
    have the necessary resources to support collaboration and that resources are
    allocated appropriately to ensure that all collaborators can contribute
    effectively.
