    > Decentralized science (DeSci) is a movement that aims to build public
    infrastructure for funding, creating, reviewing, crediting, storing, and
    disseminating scientific knowledge fairly and equitably using the Web3 stack
    â€“ Ethereum.org 


    There is a lot to unpack in this definition, with each term such as
    "funding, creating, reviewing, crediting, storing, and disseminating"
    requiring detailed explanation. Undoubtedly, science has played a major role
    in making the world a better place for humans than ever before. Private
    industry readily supports areas of innovation that promise short-term
    financial gains, while research in fields that lack direct monetary
    benefits, such as space exploration, bio research, and pollution control,
    rely heavily on government funding. Unfortunately, the outcomes of such
    research often prioritize theoretical publications over real-world impact.


    DeSci is an experimental field that takes cues from open-source software
    development, as well as DeFi and Decentralized Autonomous Organization
    concepts, to streamline and optimize the entire research process. By
    employing mechanisms such as public open grants, incentivized coordination,
    effort tracking, and reward distribution, DeSci aims to make research more
    efficient and effective.

    While the traditional approach to science has led to numerous advancements,
    it has not kept pace with technological advancements, resulting in a
    deteriorating process. Similar to government bodies, science institutions
    also face several issues, primarily due to centralization of
    decision-making. Additionally, the focus has shifted from making an impact
    to publishing research papers. Some of the most significant problems
    currently faced by the traditional science industry are discussed below.


    ## Funding

    Funding problems plague both the public and private sectors in science.
    Science startups face more intense funding challenges than other startups as
    their product turnaround time is longer, and initial setup costs are higher.
    Private VCs invest based solely on risk/reward and not impact.


    In the public sector, the grant mechanisms used by government entities are
    outdated and favor field veterans. It is easier to obtain funding for newer
    initiatives, which means grantees focus on completing current projects and
    starting new ones rather than ensuring long-term usefulness of current
    projects. Grant distribution is also biased, with veterans giving grants to
    other veterans, making it challenging for new members to secure funding.


    ## Relevance

    Most research done by PhDs is buried in research papers, and the focus is
    solely on publishing rather than applicability of research. Academic
    institutions have minimum publication requirements for tenured positions.
    After research is published, academics do not make an effort to ensure the
    industry is aware of it or that others can use their research.


    Furthermore, many researchers prioritize using checklists for methods
    applicability, data availability, and result derivability, rather than
    focusing on novelty of topics or ideas. Newer areas have relatively less
    literature or data available, making it challenging to apply existing models
    or methods, which discourages working on the latest trends.


    ## Research Collaboration

    Traditionally, academic and scientific research has been conducted in
    isolation, with little effort made to build upon the work of others or to
    facilitate collaboration. However, with the advent of modern coordination
    mechanisms, such as those used in open-source software projects, it is now
    possible for researchers to work together in a more transparent and
    efficient manner. These projects allow for open collaboration and provide
    easy access to project resources, enabling new team members to quickly get
    up to speed with the project.


    ## Intellectual Property Ownership

    Intellectual property (IP) refers to legal rights granted to inventors and
    creators, such as patents, copyrights, and trademarks. However, the rules
    for IP ownership and transfer can vary significantly between research
    institutions. In many cases, the IP produced by researchers is not easily
    transferable or awarded in a flexible manner that reflects the contributions
    of team members.


    ## Reward Distribution

    Despite the potential market value of the IP produced, there is often a lack
    of reward structures in place for researchers. This can lead to a shift in
    focus from the research itself to obtaining a tenured position.
    Additionally, there is often no clear or flexible way to distribute rewards
    based on individual contributions to the project.

    DeFi can help solve many of these problems we discussed in the previous
    section. DeSci is still an experimental area, but has been drawing a lot of
    attention.  We will see real projects who are targeting these areas and
    making a lot of progress. Our focus is learn from the new primitives and
    from the new projects to see what all can we borrow and make use of in our
    project or situation. Lets look at the things that DeSci provides
