##### What is LabDAO's approach to accelerating progress in biomedicine?  

- [ ]  Creating an open exchange of wet-lab and dry-lab tooling
- [ ]  Defining standards around biomedical tools
- [ ]  Incentivizing contributors to develop applications and provide instrumentation
- [x]  All of the above
  
Hint: NoHint
         
Explanation: LabDAO's approach involves creating an open exchange of wet-lab and dry-lab tooling, defining standards around biomedical tools to increase reproducibility and transparency, and incentivizing contributors to develop applications and provide instrumentation. LabDAO believes that abstracted infrastructure, such as cloud computing, has lowered the upfront cost of starting a new technology company.

##### What is PLEX?  

- [x]  A software to run computational biology tools
- [ ]  A protein folding tool
- [ ]  A small molecule binding tool
- [ ]  A laboratory tool
  
Hint: NoHint

##### What is small molecule binding affinity?  

- [ ]  The strength of the interaction between a small molecule and a target, typically a protein
- [x]  The interaction between a small molecule and a target, typically a protein
- [ ]  The process of bringing the small molecule and target into proximity
- [ ]  The likelihood that the drug candidate's clinical effect is due to its interaction with the target
  
Hint: NoHint
         
Explanation: The concept of small molecule binding involves investigating the interaction between a small molecule and a target, typically a protein. The process involves bringing the small molecule and the target into proximity, either through in silico or laboratory methods, with the aim of determining whether there is binding between them.

##### How does LabDAO believe abstracted infrastructure can facilitate the growth of new life science companies?  

- [ ]  By increasing the cost of starting a new technology company
- [x]  By reducing the upfront cost of starting a new technology company
- [ ]  By increasing the regulatory approval processes for new companies
- [ ]  By decreasing the reproducibility and transparency of biomedical tools
  
Hint: NoHint
         
Explanation: LabDAO's approach involves creating an open exchange of wet-lab and dry-lab tooling, defining standards around biomedical tools to increase reproducibility and transparency, and incentivizing contributors to develop applications and provide instrumentation.
