##### What is the IP-NFT protocol?  

- [ ]  A legal contract for funding research projects
- [ ]  A marketplace for buying and selling NFTs
- [x]  A protocol for tokenizing intellectual property and research data
- [ ]  A program for accelerating the development of decentralized biotech organizations
  
Hint: NoHint
         
Explanation: IP-NFT (Intellectual Property - Non-Fungible Token) combines legal and smart contract primitives. This protocol enables the tokenization of intellectual property and research data, allowing for the creation of cryptographic tokens on the Ethereum blockchain. These tokens unify the legal rights, data access, and economics around research projects, allowing for more efficient and transparent management of research funding.

##### How can IP-NFTs be divided?  

- [ ]  They cannot be divided
- [x]  They can be divided into smaller fractions
- [ ]  They can only be divided into two parts
- [ ]  They can be divided into fractions but cannot be distributed for ownership.
  
Hint: NoHint
         
Explanation: IP-NFTs can be divided into smaller fractions to allow for distributed ownership, licensing, and governance.

##### What is the significant risk associated with traditional IP?  

- [ ]  Web3 experimentation
- [x]  Dispute over control
- [ ]  Liability from economic experimentation
- [ ]  Poor choices about when or whether to file a patent
  
Hint: NoHint
         
Explanation: One significant risk associated with traditional IP is the possibility of a dispute over control, both due to inadequate default IP laws and jurisdictional conflicts.

##### What are some of the potential risks associated with using IP-NFTs to commercialize intellectual property assets?  

- [ ]  Inadequate default IP laws and jurisdictional conflicts leading to disputes over control
- [ ]  Difficulty in determining when and whether to file a patent on IP-NFTs
- [ ]  Limited ability to fractionalize ownership and governance of IP-NFTs
- [x]  Exposure of IP to new risks and liability from economic experimentation
  
Hint: NoHint
         
Explanation: Exposure of IP to new risks and liability from economic experimentation are some of the potential risks associated with using IP-NFTs to commercialize intellectual property assets.
