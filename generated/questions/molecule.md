##### What is the IP-NFT protocol?  

- [ ]  A legal contract for funding research projects
- [ ]  A marketplace for buying and selling NFTs
- [x]  A protocol for tokenizing intellectual property and research data
- [ ]  A program for accelerating the development of decentralized biotech organizations
  
Hint: NoHint
         
Explanation: IP-NFT (Intellectual Property - Non-Fungible Token) combines legal and smart contract primitives. This protocol enables the tokenization of intellectual property and research data, allowing for the creation of cryptographic tokens on the Ethereum blockchain. These tokens unify the legal rights, data access, and economics around research projects, allowing for more efficient and transparent management of research funding.

##### Can IP-NFTs be fractionalized?  

- [ ]  No, They cannot be divided
- [x]  Yes, They can be divided into smaller fractions
- [ ]  Yes, but they can only be divided into two parts
- [ ]  Yes, They can be divided into fractions but cannot be distributed for ownership.
  
Hint: NoHint
         
Explanation: IP-NFTs can be divided into smaller fractions to allow for distributed ownership, licensing, and governance.

##### Which of the following statements are correct about Molecule DAO?  

- [ ]  Molecule DAO seeks to democratize access to funding for promising early-stage therapeutic research
- [ ]  Molecule DAO hopes to create a new creator economy for researchers that allows for the rapid funding, discovery, and development of therapeutics through globally connected patient collectives
- [ ]  Molecule DAO believes that by utilizing a combination of unique digital asset identifiers (NFTs), automatic exchange infrastructure, and governance structures, they can reinvent IP ownership
- [x]  All of the above
  
Hint: NoHint
         
Explanation: With a vision to create an open marketplace that connects patients directly with researchers, Molecule DAO seeks to democratize access to funding for promising early-stage therapeutic research. The team behind Molecule DAO believes that by utilizing a combination of unique digital asset identifiers (NFTs), automatic exchange infrastructure, and governance structures, they can reinvent IP ownership and financing of these assets in a decentralized manner. Ultimately, Molecule DAO hopes to create a new creator economy for researchers that allows for the rapid funding, discovery, and development of therapeutics through globally connected patient collectives.
