      "details": "Smart contract auditing is the process of reviewing and testing the source code of a smart contract to identify any potential vulnerabilities or security issues. This can include checking for errors in the code, evaluating the contract's overall design and architecture, and testing the contract's functionality to ensure that it performs as intended. The goal of a smart contract audit is to ensure that the contract is secure and reliable, and that it will function as intended when deployed on a blockchain network.\n\n",

          "details": "> Decentralized science (DeSci) is a movement that aims to build public infrastructure for funding, creating, reviewing, crediting, storing, and disseminating scientific knowledge fairly and equitably using the Web3 stack â€“ Ethereum.org \n\nThere is a lot to unpack in this definition, with each term such as \"funding, creating, reviewing, crediting, storing, and disseminating\" requiring detailed explanation. Undoubtedly, science has played a major role in making the world a better place for humans than ever before. Private industry readily supports areas of innovation that promise short-term financial gains, while research in fields that lack direct monetary benefits, such as space exploration, bio research, and pollution control, rely heavily on government funding. Unfortunately, the outcomes of such research often prioritize theoretical publications over real-world impact.\n\nDeSci is an experimental field that takes cues from open-source software development, as well as DeFi and Decentralized Autonomous Organization concepts, to streamline and optimize the entire research process. By employing mechanisms such as public open grants, incentivized coordination, effort tracking, and reward distribution, DeSci aims to make research more efficient and effective.",
