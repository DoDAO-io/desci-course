          "details": "> Decentralized science (DeSci) is a movement that aims to build public infrastructure for funding, creating, reviewing, crediting, storing, and disseminating scientific knowledge fairly and equitably using the Web3 stack – Ethereum.org \n\nThere is a lot to unpack in this definition, with each term such as \"funding, creating, reviewing, crediting, storing, and disseminating\" requiring detailed explanation. Undoubtedly, science has played a major role in making the world a better place for humans than ever before. Private industry readily supports areas of innovation that promise short-term financial gains, while research in fields that lack direct monetary benefits, such as space exploration, bio research, and pollution control, rely heavily on government funding. Unfortunately, the outcomes of such research often prioritize theoretical publications over real-world impact.\n\nDeSci is an experimental field that takes cues from open-source software development, as well as DeFi and Decentralized Autonomous Organization concepts, to streamline and optimize the entire research process. By employing mechanisms such as public open grants, incentivized coordination, effort tracking, and reward distribution, DeSci aims to make research more efficient and effective.\n\nAlthough DeSci concepts can be applied in any sector, there has been a notable increase in the adoption of decentralized concepts and primitives within the field of biopharma. Therefore, this course will specifically concentrate on the implementation of DeSci in the biopharma science domain.\n"

          "title": "Traditional Science ",
          "shortTitle": "Traditional Science ",
          "details": "The traditional approach to science has not kept pace with technological advancements, and science institutions face several issues due to centralization of decision-making. Some of the significant problems include issues with technology transfer offices, commercialization, funding, collaboration, and relevance. These issues affect biopharma researchers' ability to bring new drugs and therapies to market, secure funding, collaborate effectively, and ensure the industry is aware of their research. Let's discuss these issues in detail\n\n## Issues with Technology Transfer Offices (TTOs)\nThe transfer of technology from academia to the market is a vital function carried out by Technology Transfer Offices (TTOs), enabling scientific research to be translated into tangible products and services that benefit society. Nonetheless, TTOs and researchers are confronted with numerous challenges, including conflicts with tenure and promotion policies, limited resources, complex legal and regulatory requirements, and difficulties in identifying potential commercial partners.\n\nTTOs outside of the top universities often encounter issues due to limited budgets and expertise, including intellectual property management, commercialization and licensing, funding and budget constraints, legal and regulatory compliance, collaboration and partnerships, and a limited understanding of business and entrepreneurship. Furthermore, cultural disparities and language barriers can pose difficulties for researchers operating across multiple countries and regions.\n\n## Commercialization\nThe commercialization of biopharmaceutical research is an arduous process due to various challenges such as regulatory barriers, concerns surrounding intellectual property, and the high costs associated with drug development. The regulatory process is both time-consuming and expensive, often requiring researchers to conduct multiple clinical trials before their drug can be approved for commercialization. Keeping up with the evolving regulatory landscape is crucial to ensure compliance.\n\nDrug development is a risky and potentially lucrative venture, with high failure rates. Only a small percentage of compounds that undergo development are ultimately approved for market, and those that do often come with a hefty price tag. Given these complex processes, many biopharmaceutical researchers are hesitant to pursue commercialization. However, it is only through commercialization and mass production that drugs can become widely accessible to patients. Unfortunately, much research is left unpublished and not pursued for commercialization, denying patients the benefits of new discoveries.\n\n## Funding \nBringing a new drug or therapy to market in the biopharmaceutical industry typically requires a substantial amount of funding to cover expenses such as clinical trials, regulatory approvals, and manufacturing. However, due to the high level of risk involved, investors may be reluctant to invest in biopharma research, resulting in a lack of funding for promising research projects.\n\nMoreover, research projects focused on rare diseases or conditions may struggle to secure sufficient funding, as they may not have a large enough market to be financially viable. These challenges make it difficult for biopharma researchers to obtain the necessary funding to bring their research to fruition.\n\nIn the public sector, government grant mechanisms are outdated and tend to favor established researchers, making it easier for them to secure funding for new initiatives. Consequently, grantees often prioritize completing current projects and starting new ones over ensuring the long-term effectiveness of existing projects. Additionally, there is a bias in grant distribution, as veteran researchers often prefer to grant funding to other veterans, making it challenging for new researchers to obtain funding.\n\n\n## Collaboration Issues\nCollaboration can be a challenging prospect for biopharma researchers due to several obstacles. One of the primary hurdles is the highly competitive nature of the industry, which can discourage companies from collaborating with rivals and sharing critical resources, including patient data or specialized equipment.\n\nAnother significant challenge is the lack of standardization in data and research protocols. Biopharma researchers frequently use varying methods for collecting and analyzing data, making it difficult to compare study results. This issue can be particularly problematic when attempting to reproduce study outcomes, a crucial step in the drug development process. Moreover, regulatory agencies may impose different clinical trial and data collection requirements, further complicating the collaboration process.\n\n\n## Relevance\nMost research done by PhDs is buried in research papers, and the focus is solely on publishing rather than applicability of research. Academic institutions have minimum publication requirements for tenured positions. After research is published, academics do not make an effort to ensure the industry is aware of it or that others can use their research.\n\nFurthermore, many researchers prioritize using checklists for methods applicability, data availability, and result derivability, rather than focusing on novelty of topics or ideas. Newer areas have relatively less literature or data available, making it challenging to apply existing models or methods, which discourages working on the latest trends.\n\n## Intellectual Property Ownership\nOne of the significant challenges facing biopharmaceutical researchers is protecting the intellectual property associated with their products. The patent process for biopharmaceuticals is complicated, time-consuming, and expensive, and infringement of existing patents can result in costly legal battles, delaying the introduction of new products to market. Researchers must navigate the complex landscape of existing IP rights while ensuring that their innovations do not infringe on other patents.\n\n## Reward Distribution\nDespite the potential market value of the IP produced, there is often a lack of reward structures in place for researchers. This can lead to a shift in focus from the research itself to obtaining a tenured position. Additionally, there is often no clear or flexible way to distribute rewards based on individual contributions to the project."

          "title": "DeSci Benefits",
          "shortTitle": "DeSci Benefits",
          "details": "DeFi has the potential to address many of the problems we discussed earlier, and DeSci, while still experimental, has garnered a lot of attention. There are real-world projects targeting these areas and making significant progress. Our focus is to learn from the new primitives and projects in order to determine what we can borrow and apply in our own project or situation. Let's explore the benefits provided by DeSci.\n\n## Assistance with Funding\nAs we previously mentioned, it is easy to raise funds in a transparent manner using DeFi primitives like Bonding Curves and Liquidity Bootstrapping Pools. In DeSci, even more innovative formats are being used for funding. Communities or Decentralized Autonomous Organizations are formed around causes such as Longevity, Psychedelics, and Hair Loss. These communities have their own tokens that help create a treasury, and members vote to select the projects or researchers to fund. Even traditional pharma players are participating in these models. For example, VitaDAO, a DAO focused on raising funds for research on extending human life, closed a $4.1 million funding round with Pfizer Ventures and several others.\n\n## Flexible Intellectual Property Ownership\nDeSci uses Ethereum's ERC-20 tokens and ERC-721 NFT standards to represent intellectual property on the blockchain. Molecule has developed an \"IP-NFT\" as an Intellectual Property primitive. These IP-NFTs connect IP and research data rights to NFTs using legal contracts attached to smart contracts. They represent a new paradigm in legal contracts for scientific research and are stored on Ethereum. IP-NFTs can be transferred, used in DeFi, fractionalized, and enable crowd control of ethics in commercialization. They also bring unprecedented liquidity to IP markets.\n\n## Reputation instead of Citation\nDeFi and blockchain are currently experimenting with many reputation primitives like badges, soulbound tokens, and non-transferrable tokens, which can be used to encourage a multitude of tasks that are needed for the continuity of research in a field, rather than just focusing on the number of research papers or citations. Since this reputation lives on the blockchain, anyone can see how the reputation was built, using what parameters, and from which projects.\n\n## Reproducibility\nIn traditional science, there is not much incentive to verify the process, mathematical models, data, and results of the research. There are some check and balancers, but no one invests time to reverify the details. In fields like Bio/Pharma, it is essential that the results are easily reproducible. In 2022, the world learned about the manipulated study on Alzheimer's. The study contained forged images of the results, and no one verified the research for more than a decade. Other researchers based their research on those results. The National Institution of Health paid hundreds of millions of dollars to projects that were either directly or indirectly based on that manipulated research. By adding new incentives and reputation, much focus can be made on the reproducibility and verification of the research.\n\n## Communication and Collaboration\nSometimes, it's the culture that brings in a shift, more than the technology itself. There are hundreds of tools available that help in collaboration based on a cause or a topic. These tools have been extensively used in Software Development teams or Blockchain teams. With DeSci, we see communities bringing in the same culture of openness and collaboration, enabling researchers, scientists, academicians, students, and industry experts to collaborate towards common causes.\n\n\n\n\n\n"

          "details": "Molecule DAO is an ambitious project aimed at revolutionizing the drug development industry. With a vision to create an open marketplace that connects patients directly with researchers, Molecule DAO seeks to democratize access to funding for promising early-stage therapeutic research. The team behind Molecule DAO believes that by utilizing a combination of unique digital asset identifiers (NFTs), automatic exchange infrastructure, and governance structures, they can reinvent IP ownership and financing of these assets in a decentralized manner. Ultimately, Molecule DAO hopes to create a new creator economy for researchers that allows for the rapid funding, discovery, and development of therapeutics through globally connected patient collectives. In this introduction, we explore the challenges that the drug development industry currently faces and how Molecule DAO aims to address them.\n\nMolecule operates across three different areas: protocol development, marketplace creation, and BioDAO launchpad.\n\nFirstly, Molecule has created a new protocol called IP-NFT (Intellectual Property - Non-Fungible Token) which combines legal and smart contract primitives. This protocol enables the tokenization of intellectual property and research data, allowing for the creation of cryptographic tokens on the Ethereum blockchain. These tokens unify the legal rights, data access, and economics around research projects, allowing for more efficient and transparent management of research funding.\n\nSecondly, Molecule is building a marketplace on top of the IP-NFT protocol, called Molecule Discovery. The marketplace enables researchers and funders to connect and collaborate on translational research projects. Researchers can propose research ideas, which are evaluated by funders and negotiated on the platform, resulting in funding agreements. The marketplace aims to improve the funding process for research projects by providing a more streamlined and transparent platform for collaboration.\n\nThirdly, Molecule operates a BioDAO launchpad, which incubates decentralized biotech IP and R&D organizations called BioDAOs. These communities consist of patients, researchers, and enthusiasts who come together to fund research in specific therapeutic areas. The BioDAO launchpad fosters demand and supply for the marketplace by incubating and supporting BioDAOs through an accelerator program. This program helps to create a new class of decentralized biotech organizations that can help to accelerate the development of new therapeutics and treatments.\n"

          "title": "IP-NFT",
          "shortTitle": "IP-NFT",
          "details": "#### What is IP-NFT?\n\nIP-NFT stands for Intellectual Property - Non-Fungible Token. Molecule created the first IP-NFTs for [VitaDAO](https://www.vitadao.com/), which enabled them to register their intellectual property and research and development data rights for their sponsored research in longevity therapeutics. By attaching legal contracts such as sponsored research agreements to smart contracts, IP-NFTs connect IP and R&D data rights to NFTs on the [Ethereum](https://www.ethereum.org/) blockchain. IP-NFTs serve as the [building blocks](https://molecule.to/blog/ip-nfts-for-researchers-a-new-biomedical-funding-paradigm) for decentralized science (DeSci), much like [DeFi legos](https://www.defipulse.com/blog/what-is-defi) for DeSci. They represent a new paradigm in the evolution of legal contracts for scientific research, moving from paper or electronic file folders to smart contracts on the Ethereum blockchain. IP-NFTs can be transferred peer-to-peer, made [composable](https://blog.aragon.org/what-is-composability/) with DeFi, fractionalized to distribute licenses and governance to groups of people. They can also be built upon to unlock new ways to interact with and develop IP, R&D data, and [NIPIA](https://www.aaup.org/sites/default/files/files/IntangibleAssets.pdf) (Non-IP Intangible Assets). \n\n#### Why mint an IP-NFT?\n\nAn IP-NFT can be minted by a research sponsor, biotech company, or researcher to benefit from the attachment of intellectual property (IP) and research and development (R&D) rights to an Ethereum smart contract. As described above, the benefits of IP-NFTs include:\n- Permissionless peer-to-peer transferability as smart contracts on Ethereum - Composability with DeFi - Fractionalization for the distribution of licenses and governance to groups of individuals - Development of new ways to interact with and develop IP, R&D data, and Non-IP Intangible Assets (NIPIA) such as trade secrets and publicity rights - Empowerment of crowd control of ethics in commercialization based on FRAND terms - Unprecedented liquidity in IP markets\n\nIn addition, IP-NFTs offer non-dilutive funding opportunities for researchers seeking to sell IP and data rights without having to apply for grants or sell shares of spin-off companies. Once an IP-NFT is minted, the user has attached the specified IP, NIPIA, and R&D data rights to a non-fungible token on Ethereum. These rights transfer with the token when it is transferred, providing ease of transferability and verified ownership of rights through the blockchain.\nOther reasons to mint IP-NFTs include:\n- **Composability with DeFi**: IP-NFTs can be used as building blocks in DeSci and [mixed with other software components like lego bricks](https://twitter.com/cdixon/status/1451703070589587456?s=20&t=GsFYFskx2cmqYnUjL1PGuw). For instance, they can be used as collateral to mint stablecoins in MakerDAO, traded on marketplaces like [OpenSea](https://opensea.io/) and [Gem](https://www.gem.xyz/), or listed in a bespoke IP marketplace like [Molecule Discovery](https://molecule.to/blog/an-open-bazaar-for-drug-development-molecule-protocol). Fractionalization (IP-NFT fractionalization is a technique that allows for the direct distribution of IP-NFT rights to groups of token holders by locking the IP-NFT and generating tokens on Ethereum that represent fractions of the locked IP-NFT) is also possible on platforms like [Fractional.art](http://www.fractional.art/) and the FRENS & FAM legal+smart contract protocol.\n- **Creation of efficiencies in IP licensing**: IP-NFTs provide transparency in IP ownership and valuation, which can make due diligence for licensing deals easier and less costly.\n- **Creation of entirely new IP markets**: Early-stage IP-NFTs can represent rights to future IP arising from a research project, while late-stage IP-NFTs can represent trade secrets and patents on inventions that arise from the project. Licensing terms, ethical conditions, and governance clauses can be encoded into IP-NFTs as license wrappers. This allows for efficient trading of IP rights before pursuing patents and the potential for a Cambrian explosion of novel applications for decentralized IP ownership, governance, and commercialization.\n\nTo mint an IP-NFT using Molecule, follow these steps:\n\n- **Request a mintpass**: Minting of IP-NFTs on Molecule is currently in closed beta, so you'll need to request a mintpass to get started. You can request [here](https://airtable.com/shr9QN0tPPeK4GGjA). - **Create and sign a legal agreement**: Two parties must negotiate and sign a legal contract that includes two agreements. The first agreement states the rights of the asset holder and the price paid for the asset, while the second agreement assigns the rights of the buyer within the first agreement to the holder of a certain token of the IP-NFT smart contract. - **Access the minting front-end**: Visit the [minting front-end](https://mint.molecule.to/) and connect your wallet to get started with the process. - **Reserve an IP-NFT**: To enable the encryption of your documents, Molecule reserves a TokenID for your NFT. This TokenID will be used to ensure that only the owner of the TokenID can access the data behind the NFT. - **Describe your IP-NFT**: Add all the information about your IP-NFT, including what kind of agreement will be connected to the IP-NFT and whether the agreement should be stored publicly or privately. All information in this step will be saved in the metadata of the IP-NFT and will be publicly available. - **Attach your signed legal agreement and artwork**: Upload the signed legal agreement from step 2 to the Molecule Platform. This document will be encrypted and stored on a decentralized data storage. Additionally, add artwork to become the memorable image of your IP-NFT. - **Review your IP-NFT data**: Review the data submitted for the IP-NFT. Once ready, continue the process. After submitting your data in this step, the contract will be encrypted and uploaded to the decentralized data storage. The decryption key will be stored with Lit Protocol to manage access control based on the NFT ownership. - **Sign IP-NFT minting transaction**: Your metamask will pop-up and ask you to sign a transaction to mint the IP-NFT. - **View your IP-NFT**: Once the transaction goes through, you will find an IP-NFT in your wallet. Congratulations, you have successfully created an IP-NFT!\n"

The platform allows you to sort projects based on clinical stages and opportunity types. Additionally, there is a free text search option available to make it easier to find relevant research projects.\n\nMolecule Discovery offers user accounts that facilitate collaboration on various research projects. Researchers can create and manage their own projects using their accounts, while investors can inquire about projects and whitelist to fund researchers.\n\nMolecule's primary goal is to assist biopharma researchers in finding resources and partners to execute their research projects. One of the most common issues in early-stage biopharma research is the difficulty in acquiring funding and the length of time it takes to secure such funding. This issue can arise due to a variety of factors, such as complex contracts, limited access to funding sources, and challenges in aligning multiple stakeholders.\n\nTo address these obstacles, Molecule has developed a unique IP-NFT framework. Our team has created a set of standardized legal agreements that are linked to non-fungible tokens, enabling researchers to receive funding from existing early-stage investors. This approach aims to simplify the funding process and streamline the acquisition of necessary resources for biopharma research.\n"

          "details": "A BioDAO is a type of Decentralized Autonomous Organisation (DAO) that uses decentralised services in the field of decentralised science (DeSci) to shape the future of therapeutic development. DAOs are made up of communities of individuals with diverse backgrounds who jointly allocate resources towards a common goal. When it comes to financial resources, public decentralised ledger technology such as Ethereum is used to enable all parties to collaborate in a trustless manner and democratically decide on how to allocate resources.\n\nOne of the key services offered by BioDAOs is the tokenization of intellectual property (IP) rights using non-fungible tokens (NFTs) to create liquid IP-NFTs. These IP-NFTs can be bought, held, managed, and sold by DAOs, allowing them to contribute to the advancement of science.\n\n#### Different Types of BioDAOs\n- **Community & Therapeutic Areas**: DAOs can be created by existing communities or individuals interested in a particular therapeutic area. Examples include VitaDAO and PsyDAO, which actively support research in their respective areas and educate the community through AMAs, Twitter Spaces, and other content.\n- **Nonprofits and Patient Organizations**: Nonprofits and patient organizations can be structured as DAOs to use Web3 fundraising mechanisms for public goods. This allows more people to take an active role in the BIO Ecosystem and support neglected and underfunded research areas. An excellent example is Crowdfunded Cures and To Cure a Rose, which create new value layers in the therapeutic space.\n- **Service Provider DAOs**: With the adoption of the IP-NFT standard and more efforts to conduct research in a decentralized way, we will see more DAOs actively building tools and services for researchers, such as LabDAO and CureDAO.\n- **Investment Syndicates**: DAOs don't have to consist of a large number of contributors; they can start as small as two individuals who collectively want to pool funds and support therapeutic research over our Discovery Platform as a Syndicate.\n- **BioLAOs**: A BioLAO is a community of BIO enthusiasts and experts who support the work of researchers and builders through advice and capital.\n\n#### The BIO DAO Lifecycle\nDAOs go through different stages, from an idea to a fully grown organization. The growth sequence for a BioDAO typically includes specific building blocks. Molecule provides support at each of these stages.\n"

          "details": "Over the last 20 years, open-source code has accelerated progress in information technology by enabling the sharing of code at a low cost and with high reliability. The sharing of code is facilitated by technology market dynamics, in which intellectual property is less relevant than the ability to execute, time to market, and trade secrets around implementation.\nHowever, open-source biomedicine is still waiting for its moment. Progress in biomedicine has been slowed down by the high cost of reproducing life science processes and the low reliability of generating expected results. Sharing instructions is hampered by intellectual property and trade secrets, the primary mode of defense against competitors during the lengthy regulatory approval processes seen in the life science industry.\nWhile cloud computing providers have removed the barriers to executing code by moving hardware online, there is no comparable layer of abstraction for dry-lab and wet-lab tools in biomedicine. LabDAO believes that an open-source exchange for dry-lab and wet-lab tools could help reduce the high costs created by secrecy around biomedical tooling, increase the reproducibility of biomedical tools, and foster the emergence of independent entities that maintain open-source tools.\n\n#### Solution\n\nTo accelerate progress, LabDAO enables scientists to share their specialized tools and services with each other easily. Researchers can discover tools and projects on an open exchange instead of going through a lengthy search for collaborators or service providers.\nLabDAO's approach involves creating an open exchange of wet-lab and dry-lab tooling, defining standards around biomedical tools to increase reproducibility and transparency, and incentivizing contributors to develop applications and provide instrumentation. LabDAO believes that abstracted infrastructure, such as cloud computing, has lowered the upfront cost of starting a new technology company. Similarly, they are convinced that such abstracted infrastructure in biomedicine, both in the dry-lab and wet-lab domain, can facilitate the growth of new life science companies.\n"

          "shortTitle": "LabDAO Intro",
          "details": "To better understand LabDAO's approach, let's first have a look on what is an effective research environment.\n\n#### What defines an effective research environment?\n\nAn effective research environment is crucial for scientists to achieve their goals. The following factors define such an environment:\n- Access to Scientific Infrastructure: The availability of scientific infrastructure is paramount for scientists to conduct targeted tinkering. New methods and technologies that allow for a novel approach to discovering something about the world are often crucial for scientific breakthroughs. In order to make progress, scientists need to have access to the tools and equipment necessary to conduct their experiments.\n- Dynamic Teams: The ability to form dynamic teams is also an important component of an effective research environment. Unlike traditional labs where teams are formed around a professor, dynamic teams are often project-focused and assembled to solve a particular problem or address a specific need. Such teams allow for micro-expertise, where individuals with specialized skills can come together to tackle a specific scientific challenge.\n- Funding to Develop Infrastructure and Accelerate Inventors: Funding is crucial for scientists to develop initial infrastructure and accelerate their inventions. A smooth project size distribution, as proposed by Ben Reinhardt, is necessary to achieve this. This means that funding should be available to grow a project from just an idea to a research project, and eventually to a serious technology company. Such funding can come from a variety of sources, including government grants, venture capital firms, and philanthropic organizations.\n\n#### Where does LabDAO come in?\n\nIn recent times, there has been a surge in various projects that are aimed at supporting scientific research through funding agencies and execution agencies, as well as distribution mechanisms. However, the middle ground where scientists and their tools can interact is missing, which is where LabDAO comes in with its focus on team and tool development. LabDAO's mission is to provide a space where scientists can collaborate and access the necessary tools to generate and distribute their research.\nOne of the challenges in decentralized science is bringing tools into an online room where they can be utilized effectively. A crucial question to address is how to bring tools like a cell culture bench into an online chat room. LabDAO's answer is to create a marketplace protocol where labs can offer their services and share them in a structured format. This approach will enable scientists to access the necessary tools and generate new data, which they can then distribute. LabDAO's focus on building a supportive ecosystem for scientific research provides a promising avenue for scientists to collaborate, access necessary tools, and distribute their research effectively. To achieve their mission, LabDAO has categorized the exchange for laboratory services under Lab Exchange and the set of required tools under Lab Teams. Let's have a look.\n#### Lab Exchange\n\nLabExchange is a peer-to-peer exchange for laboratory services that operates under a DAO governance structure. It offers a marketplace protocol where laboratories can provide data-generating services such as testing the binding behavior of a specific target or synthesizing small molecules. The exchange is currently in its early stages, and its client, which is designed for computational biologists, is pre-release. The exchange lists available apps, ranging from simple functions like reverse complement to complex ones like protein folding, and allows data sharing via the InterPlanetary File System (IPFS) and Estuary.\nLabExchange aims to create a structured format for laboratories to offer their services and for teams of scientists and their tools to interact. It provides \"lab teams\" as a way for scientists to collaborate and become discoverable by people with micro-expertise. The marketplace protocol enables laboratories, both for-profit and non-profit, to share their services, which scientists can use to generate new data. The goal is to create an online space where tools like a cell culture bench can be brought into an online chat room, allowing scientists to access specific services and generate new data. While the protocol is still in its early stages, it provides a promising avenue for scientific research.\n\n#### Lab Teams\n\nLabTeams are a crucial component of enabling scientific progress and collaboration through dynamic team formation among scientists. The role of subject matter stewards in leading a group and guiding expert attention is important for initiating projects and facilitating conversations. However, to effectively concentrate expertise, there needs to be tools for collective intelligence that allow even outsiders to contribute their micro expertise.\nIn order to encourage scientists to contribute to the LabDAO, there are onboarding flows that explain decentralized science and take users through a step-by-step process to join the community. The LabDAO is a community of people focused on specific problems, project ideas, or open-source repositories, where labs develop their own culture and track their contributions. Through this open-source community, standardizations around laboratory services can emerge, leading to many-to-many relationships and providing physical laboratory services to online research communities.\nLabDAO's approach to creating a marketplace protocol where laboratories can offer their services and share them in a structured format addresses the challenge of bringing tools like a cell culture bench into an online chat room. With LabTeams, scientists can collaborate, access necessary tools, and generate new data to distribute their research effectively. By creating a supportive ecosystem for scientific research, LabDAO provides a promising avenue for scientific progress and collaboration.\n"

          "details": "#### Introducing PLEX\n\nTo purse the DeSci future, LabDAO has a goal to make Bio ML tools more accessible and clinically relevant. In a quest to build best-in-class tools, they have built tools for Small Molecule Binding and Protein Folding initially, so that you don’t have to spend days researching and setting up Bio ML tools.\n#### What is PLEX?\n\nPLEX is a piece of software that allows you to run computational biology tools using simple commands from your computer.\nPLEX manages all the required dependencies and installations, to make the tools as easy to run as possible.\nWhen you run a tool, PLEX requests compute-time from members of the LabDAO network, so you don’t have to worry about hardware requirements for setting up the necessary compute infrastructure.\n#### What is Small Molecule Binding?\n\nThe concept of small molecule binding involves investigating the interaction between a small molecule and a target, typically a protein. The process involves bringing the small molecule and the target into proximity, either through in silico or laboratory methods, with the aim of determining whether there is binding between them. The key questions that need to be answered are whether the small molecule binds to the protein and, if so, what is the strength of this interaction. The strength of the interaction is commonly known as the \"binding affinity\".\n#### Introduction to Small Molecule Binding Affinity\n\nSmall molecule binding affinity refers to the strength of the interaction between a small molecule and a target, typically a protein.\n#### Importance of Determining Binding Affinity\n\nDetermining the binding affinity is crucial as a strong interaction increases the likelihood that the drug candidate's clinical effect is due to its interaction with the target, rather than other structures in the organism. It helps to understand the target of the drug candidate and make informed decisions to increase success in later phases of drug discovery.\nIt is recommended to determine the binding affinity early in the drug discovery process to ensure that only candidates with strong binding affinity to their target protein are selected for further development.\n#### Predicting Binding Affinity\n\nMachine learning models can be utilized to predict the binding affinity of a small molecule and protein. LabDAO offers computational tools that use molecular docking to dock the small molecule and protein, and score the predicted interaction. The score, as well as two separate files showing the small molecule and protein, will be returned for further exploration.\n#### Describing Binding Affinity\n\nThe binding affinity can be described with three related metrics: ΔG (binding free energy), Kd (dissociation constant), and IC50 (half-maximal inhibitory concentration). ΔG is the most generalizable metric to describe binding affinity, while IC50 is highly context-dependent.\n#### Interpreting Binding Affinity\n\nBinding affinity data can be interpreted by comparing the ΔG, Kd, or IC50 values to a set of reference values for the target. A lower value of these metrics implies a stronger interaction between the small molecule and target protein. A strong interaction is indicated by a negative ΔG value, Kd or IC50 close to 0.\n#### Measuring Binding Affinity in the Lab\n\nSurface-Plasmon-Resonance (SPR) and Bio-layer Interferometry (BLI) are popular, accurate, and label-free methods used to measure the binding affinity of a protein and small molecule in the lab. The cost of an average SPR experiment can range from several thousand dollars to tens of thousands of dollars, depending on the experiment's complexity and equipment used.\n#### Tools for Predicting Binding Affinity\n\nThere is a wide range of tools available for predicting the binding affinity between small molecules and proteins. To help you navigate this landscape, we have researched and compiled a list of tools that are ready for use on PLEX.\nPlease note that all models provided are research-grade software and are provided \"as-is\". While they can be helpful for predicting binding affinity, they should not be considered a substitute for laboratory experiments.\nMini: Equibind Equibind is a machine learning-based docking tool that is extremely fast. While it may be less accurate than some baseline methods, it is orders of magnitude faster, making it a good choice for certain applications.\nBase: Gnina (Coming Soon) Gnina is a sampling and machine learning-based docking tool that is considered a current open source baseline. It is an implementation of Smina, which is a fork of Vina.\nStandard: Diffdock Diffdock is a machine learning-based docking tool that is reportedly faster and more accurate than existing baseline tools.\n"

VitaDAO seeks to align incentives and vitalize early-stage funding in longevity biopharma by creating entirely new open IP business models.\n\nVitaDAO's ownership and governance are managed through VITA tokens, which can be obtained by contributing work, funds, data, or intellectual property (IP) to VitaDAO. The holders of VITA tokens participate in the democratic governance of VitaDAO, direct its research, access and monetize its data repositories, and manage its IP portfolio.\n\nIn the long run, VitaDAO aims to create entirely new open IP business models that promote open science and novel data marketplaces, allowing VitaDAO to monetize its IP and data assets. As an open cooperative, anyone can join and support VitaDAO. The platform is still in its early stages but has the potential to transform the biopharma industry by creating a more collaborative and transparent approach to R&D."

VitaDAO aims to leverage Molecule's IP-NFT marketplace to help universities monetize their assets. VitaDAO's approach is to build bridges to fix existing roads.\n\n### VitaDAO Aim 2 - Enable democratic participation in longevity projects\nVitaDAO will facilitate initiatives where intellectual property is not relevant to enable democratic participation in longevity projects. Researchers and pharma companies typically focus on patents, but VitaDAO will drive success through crowdfunding and social impact bonds. NFTs might not be relevant in these cases, but VitaDAO can still distribute its $VITA tokens based on contributions. The organization aims to fix the money in healthcare to fix the world, particularly in the blockchains and Web3 space.",
