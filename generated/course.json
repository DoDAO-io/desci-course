          "details": "> Decentralized science (DeSci) is a movement that aims to build public infrastructure for funding, creating, reviewing, crediting, storing, and disseminating scientific knowledge fairly and equitably using the Web3 stack – Ethereum.org \n\nThere is a lot to unpack in this definition, with each term such as \"funding, creating, reviewing, crediting, storing, and disseminating\" requiring detailed explanation. Undoubtedly, science has played a major role in making the world a better place for humans than ever before. Private industry readily supports areas of innovation that promise short-term financial gains, while research in fields that lack direct monetary benefits, such as space exploration, bio research, and pollution control, rely heavily on government funding. Unfortunately, the outcomes of such research often prioritize theoretical publications over real-world impact.\n\nDeSci is an experimental field that takes cues from open-source software development, as well as DeFi and Decentralized Autonomous Organization concepts, to streamline and optimize the entire research process. By employing mechanisms such as public open grants, incentivized coordination, effort tracking, and reward distribution, DeSci aims to make research more efficient and effective.\n\nAlthough DeSci concepts can be applied in any sector, there has been a notable increase in the adoption of decentralized concepts and primitives within the field of biopharma. Therefore, this course will specifically concentrate on the implementation of DeSci in the biopharma science domain.\n",

          "shortTitle": "Traditional Science ",
          "details": "The traditional approach to science has not kept pace with technological advancements, and science institutions face several issues due to centralization of decision-making. Some of the significant problems include issues with technology transfer offices, commercialization, funding, collaboration, and relevance. These issues affect biopharma researchers' ability to bring new drugs and therapies to market, secure funding, collaborate effectively, and ensure the industry is aware of their research. Let's discuss these issues in detail\n\n## Issues with Technology Transfer Offices (TTOs)\nThe transfer of technology from academia to the market is a vital function carried out by Technology Transfer Offices (TTOs), enabling scientific research to be translated into tangible products and services that benefit society. Nonetheless, TTOs and researchers are confronted with numerous challenges, including conflicts with tenure and promotion policies, limited resources, complex legal and regulatory requirements, and difficulties in identifying potential commercial partners.\n\nTTOs outside of the top universities often encounter issues due to limited budgets and expertise, including intellectual property management, commercialization and licensing, funding and budget constraints, legal and regulatory compliance, collaboration and partnerships, and a limited understanding of business and entrepreneurship. Furthermore, cultural disparities and language barriers can pose difficulties for researchers operating across multiple countries and regions.\n\n## Commercialization issues\nThe commercialization of biopharmaceutical research is an arduous process due to various challenges such as regulatory barriers, concerns surrounding intellectual property, and the high costs associated with drug development. The regulatory process is both time-consuming and expensive, often requiring researchers to conduct multiple clinical trials before their drug can be approved for commercialization. Keeping up with the evolving regulatory landscape is crucial to ensure compliance.\n\nDrug development is a risky and potentially lucrative venture, with high failure rates. Only a small percentage of compounds that undergo development are ultimately approved for market, and those that do often come with a hefty price tag. Given these complex processes, many biopharmaceutical researchers are hesitant to pursue commercialization. However, it is only through commercialization and mass production that drugs can become widely accessible to patients. Unfortunately, much research is left unpublished and not pursued for commercialization, denying patients the benefits of new discoveries.\n\n## Funding - New\nBiopharmaceuticals typically require a significant amount of funding to bring a new drug or therapy to market. This can include the cost of clinical trials, regulatory approvals, and manufacturing. Investors may be hesitant to invest in biopharma research due to the high level of risk involved in bringing a new drug to market, which can lead to a lack of funding for promising research projects.\n\nAnother challenge faced by biopharma researchers is the competitive nature of the industry. There are many research projects underway in the biopharma sector, and investors may be hesitant to invest in a project that is not perceived as being innovative or groundbreaking. This can lead to a lack of funding for promising research projects, even if they have the potential to make a significant impact on patient care. Additionally, there may be limited funding available for research projects that are focused on rare diseases or conditions, as these projects may not have a large enough market to be financially viable. All of these factors can make it challenging for biopharma researchers to secure the funding they need to bring their research to fruition.\n\n## Funding\nFunding problems plague both the public and private sectors in science. Science startups face more intense funding challenges than other startups as their product turnaround time is longer, and initial setup costs are higher. Private VCs invest based solely on risk/reward and not impact.\n\nIn the public sector, the grant mechanisms used by government entities are outdated and favor field veterans. It is easier to obtain funding for newer initiatives, which means grantees focus on completing current projects and starting new ones rather than ensuring long-term usefulness of current projects. Grant distribution is also biased, with veterans giving grants to other veterans, making it challenging for new members to secure funding.\n\n## Collaboration Issues\nCollaboration can be a challenging prospect for biopharma researchers due to several obstacles. One of the primary hurdles is the highly competitive nature of the industry, which can discourage companies from collaborating with rivals and sharing critical resources, including patient data or specialized equipment.\n\nAnother significant challenge is the lack of standardization in data and research protocols. Biopharma researchers frequently use varying methods for collecting and analyzing data, making it difficult to compare study results. This issue can be particularly problematic when attempting to reproduce study outcomes, a crucial step in the drug development process. Moreover, regulatory agencies may impose different clinical trial and data collection requirements, further complicating the collaboration process.\n\n\n\n## Relevance\nMost research done by PhDs is buried in research papers, and the focus is solely on publishing rather than applicability of research. Academic institutions have minimum publication requirements for tenured positions. After research is published, academics do not make an effort to ensure the industry is aware of it or that others can use their research.\n\nFurthermore, many researchers prioritize using checklists for methods applicability, data availability, and result derivability, rather than focusing on novelty of topics or ideas. Newer areas have relatively less literature or data available, making it challenging to apply existing models or methods, which discourages working on the latest trends.\n\n## Research Collaboration\nTraditionally, academic and scientific research has been conducted in isolation, with little effort made to build upon the work of others or to facilitate collaboration. However, with the advent of modern coordination mechanisms, such as those used in open-source software projects, it is now possible for researchers to work together in a more transparent and efficient manner. These projects allow for open collaboration and provide easy access to project resources, enabling new team members to quickly get up to speed with the project.\n\n## Intellectual Property Ownership - New\n\nAnother major challenge is protecting the intellectual property associated with biopharmaceuticals. Patents are critical to securing market exclusivity and recouping the substantial investment required to develop a drug. However, protecting intellectual property can be challenging, particularly in cases where the underlying science is complex and difficult to replicate. Finally, d\n\nResearchers face significant challenges related to IP protection. One of the major issues is the complexity of the patenting process for biopharmaceuticals. Unlike traditional drugs, biologics are much more complex, making it challenging to identify the specific molecules that can be patented. As a result, the patent process is time-consuming, expensive, and uncertain, as competitors may challenge the patent's validity, resulting in costly legal battles.\n\nAnother significant challenge for biopharma researchers is the potential for infringement of other patents. With numerous patents covering different aspects of biopharmaceutical products, researchers must navigate a complicated landscape of existing IP rights. This situation can lead to disputes over IP ownership, resulting in legal disputes, and delays in bringing new products to market. Additionally, due to the high cost of developing new biopharmaceutical products, researchers may struggle to access the necessary funding and resources to bring their products to market without infringing on existing patents. Therefore, biopharma researchers must ensure that their innovations do not infringe on existing IP rights while simultaneously protecting their intellectual property.\n\n## Intellectual Property Ownership\nIntellectual property (IP) refers to legal rights granted to inventors and creators, such as patents, copyrights, and trademarks. However, the rules for IP ownership and transfer can vary significantly between research institutions. In many cases, the IP produced by researchers is not easily transferable or awarded in a flexible manner that reflects the contributions of team members.\n\n## Reward Distribution\nDespite the potential market value of the IP produced, there is often a lack of reward structures in place for researchers. This can lead to a shift in focus from the research itself to obtaining a tenured position. Additionally, there is often no clear or flexible way to distribute rewards based on individual contributions to the project.",

          "key": "desci-benefits",
          "shortTitle": "DeSci Benefits",
          "details": "DeFi has the potential to address many of the problems we discussed earlier, and DeSci, while still experimental, has garnered a lot of attention. There are real-world projects targeting these areas and making significant progress. Our focus is to learn from the new primitives and projects in order to determine what we can borrow and apply in our own project or situation. Let's explore the benefits provided by DeSci.\n\n## Assistance with Funding\nAs we previously mentioned, it is easy to raise funds in a transparent manner using DeFi primitives like Bonding Curves and Liquidity Bootstrapping Pools. In DeSci, even more innovative formats are being used for funding. Communities or Decentralized Autonomous Organizations are formed around causes such as Longevity, Psychedelics, and Hair Loss. These communities have their own tokens that help create a treasury, and members vote to select the projects or researchers to fund. Even traditional pharma players are participating in these models. For example, VitaDAO, a DAO focused on raising funds for research on extending human life, closed a $4.1 million funding round with Pfizer Ventures and several others.\n\n## Flexible Intellectual Property Ownership\nDeSci uses Ethereum's ERC-20 tokens and ERC-721 NFT standards to represent intellectual property on the blockchain. Molecule has developed an \"IP-NFT\" as an Intellectual Property primitive. These IP-NFTs connect IP and research data rights to NFTs using legal contracts attached to smart contracts. They represent a new paradigm in legal contracts for scientific research and are stored on Ethereum. IP-NFTs can be transferred, used in DeFi, fractionalized, and enable crowd control of ethics in commercialization. They also bring unprecedented liquidity to IP markets.\n\n## Reputation instead of Citation\nDeFi and blockchain are currently experimenting with many reputation primitives like badges, soulbound tokens, and non-transferrable tokens, which can be used to encourage a multitude of tasks that are needed for the continuity of research in a field, rather than just focusing on the number of research papers or citations. Since this reputation lives on the blockchain, anyone can see how the reputation was built, using what parameters, and from which projects.\n\n## Reproducibility\nIn traditional science, there is not much incentive to verify the process, mathematical models, data, and results of the research. There are some check and balancers, but no one invests time to reverify the details. In fields like Bio/Pharma, it is essential that the results are easily reproducible. In 2022, the world learned about the manipulated study on Alzheimer's. The study contained forged images of the results, and no one verified the research for more than a decade. Other researchers based their research on those results. The National Institution of Health paid hundreds of millions of dollars to projects that were either directly or indirectly based on that manipulated research. By adding new incentives and reputation, much focus can be made on the reproducibility and verification of the research.\n\n## Communication and Collaboration\nSometimes, it's the culture that brings in a shift, more than the technology itself. There are hundreds of tools available that help in collaboration based on a cause or a topic. These tools have been extensively used in Software Development teams or Blockchain teams. With DeSci, we see communities bringing in the same culture of openness and collaboration, enabling researchers, scientists, academicians, students, and industry experts to collaborate towards common causes.\n\n\n\n\n\n",

With a vision to create an open marketplace that connects patients directly with researchers, Molecule DAO seeks to democratize access to funding for promising early-stage therapeutic research. The team behind Molecule DAO believes that by utilizing a combination of unique digital asset identifiers (NFTs), automatic exchange infrastructure, and governance structures, they can reinvent IP ownership and financing of these assets in a decentralized manner. Ultimately, Molecule DAO hopes to create a new creator economy for researchers that allows for the rapid funding, discovery, and development of therapeutics through globally connected patient collectives. In this introduction, we explore the challenges that the drug development industry currently faces and how Molecule DAO aims to address them.\n\nMolecule operates across three different areas: protocol development, marketplace creation, and BioDAO launchpad.\n\nFirstly, Molecule has created a new protocol called IP-NFT (Intellectual Property - Non-Fungible Token) which combines legal and smart contract primitives. This protocol enables the tokenization of intellectual property and research data, allowing for the creation of cryptographic tokens on the Ethereum blockchain. These tokens unify the legal rights, data access, and economics around research projects, allowing for more efficient and transparent management of research funding.\n\nSecondly, Molecule is building a marketplace on top of the IP-NFT protocol, called Molecule Discovery. The marketplace enables researchers and funders to connect and collaborate on translational research projects. Researchers can propose research ideas, which are evaluated by funders and negotiated on the platform, resulting in funding agreements. The marketplace aims to improve the funding process for research projects by providing a more streamlined and transparent platform for collaboration.\n\nThirdly, Molecule operates a BioDAO launchpad, which incubates decentralized biotech IP and R&D organizations called BioDAOs. These communities consist of patients, researchers, and enthusiasts who come together to fund research in specific therapeutic areas. The BioDAO launchpad fosters demand and supply for the marketplace by incubating and supporting BioDAOs through an accelerator program. This program helps to create a new class of decentralized biotech organizations that can help to accelerate the development of new therapeutics and treatments.\n"

          "details": "#### What is IP-NFT?\n\nIP-NFT stands for Intellectual Property - Non-Fungible Token. Molecule created the first IP-NFTs for [VitaDAO](https://www.vitadao.com/), which enabled them to register their intellectual property and research and development data rights for their sponsored research in longevity therapeutics. By attaching legal contracts such as sponsored research agreements to smart contracts, IP-NFTs connect IP and R&D data rights to NFTs on the [Ethereum](https://www.ethereum.org/) blockchain. IP-NFTs serve as the [building blocks](https://molecule.to/blog/ip-nfts-for-researchers-a-new-biomedical-funding-paradigm) for decentralized science (DeSci), much like [DeFi legos](https://www.defipulse.com/blog/what-is-defi) for DeSci. They represent a new paradigm in the evolution of legal contracts for scientific research, moving from paper or electronic file folders to smart contracts on the Ethereum blockchain. IP-NFTs can be transferred peer-to-peer, made [composable](https://blog.aragon.org/what-is-composability/) with DeFi, fractionalized to distribute licenses and governance to groups of people. They can also be built upon to unlock new ways to interact with and develop IP, R&D data, and [NIPIA](https://www.aaup.org/sites/default/files/files/IntangibleAssets.pdf) (Non-IP Intangible Assets). \n\n#### Why mint an IP-NFT?\n\nAn IP-NFT can be minted by a research sponsor, biotech company, or researcher to benefit from the attachment of intellectual property (IP) and research and development (R&D) rights to an Ethereum smart contract. As described above, the benefits of IP-NFTs include:\n- Permissionless peer-to-peer transferability as smart contracts on Ethereum - Composability with DeFi - Fractionalization for the distribution of licenses and governance to groups of individuals - Development of new ways to interact with and develop IP, R&D data, and Non-IP Intangible Assets (NIPIA) such as trade secrets and publicity rights - Empowerment of crowd control of ethics in commercialization based on FRAND terms - Unprecedented liquidity in IP markets\n\nIn addition, IP-NFTs offer non-dilutive funding opportunities for researchers seeking to sell IP and data rights without having to apply for grants or sell shares of spin-off companies. Once an IP-NFT is minted, the user has attached the specified IP, NIPIA, and R&D data rights to a non-fungible token on Ethereum. These rights transfer with the token when it is transferred, providing ease of transferability and verified ownership of rights through the blockchain.\nOther reasons to mint IP-NFTs include:\n- **Composability with DeFi**: IP-NFTs can be used as building blocks in DeSci and [mixed with other software components like lego bricks](https://twitter.com/cdixon/status/1451703070589587456?s=20&t=GsFYFskx2cmqYnUjL1PGuw). For instance, they can be used as collateral to mint stablecoins in MakerDAO, traded on marketplaces like [OpenSea](https://opensea.io/) and [Gem](https://www.gem.xyz/), or listed in a bespoke IP marketplace like [Molecule Discovery](https://molecule.to/blog/an-open-bazaar-for-drug-development-molecule-protocol). Fractionalization (IP-NFT fractionalization is a technique that allows for the direct distribution of IP-NFT rights to groups of token holders by locking the IP-NFT and generating tokens on Ethereum that represent fractions of the locked IP-NFT) is also possible on platforms like [Fractional.art](http://www.fractional.art/) and the FRENS & FAM legal+smart contract protocol.\n- **Creation of efficiencies in IP licensing**: IP-NFTs provide transparency in IP ownership and valuation, which can make due diligence for licensing deals easier and less costly.\n- **Creation of entirely new IP markets**: Early-stage IP-NFTs can represent rights to future IP arising from a research project, while late-stage IP-NFTs can represent trade secrets and patents on inventions that arise from the project. Licensing terms, ethical conditions, and governance clauses can be encoded into IP-NFTs as license wrappers. This allows for efficient trading of IP rights before pursuing patents and the potential for a Cambrian explosion of novel applications for decentralized IP ownership, governance, and commercialization.\n\nTo mint an IP-NFT using Molecule, follow these steps:\n\n- **Request a mintpass**: Minting of IP-NFTs on Molecule is currently in closed beta, so you'll need to request a mintpass to get started. You can request [here](https://airtable.com/shr9QN0tPPeK4GGjA). - **Create and sign a legal agreement**: Two parties must negotiate and sign a legal contract that includes two agreements. The first agreement states the rights of the asset holder and the price paid for the asset, while the second agreement assigns the rights of the buyer within the first agreement to the holder of a certain token of the IP-NFT smart contract. - **Access the minting front-end**: Visit the [minting front-end](https://mint.molecule.to/) and connect your wallet to get started with the process. - **Reserve an IP-NFT**: To enable the encryption of your documents, Molecule reserves a TokenID for your NFT. This TokenID will be used to ensure that only the owner of the TokenID can access the data behind the NFT. - **Describe your IP-NFT**: Add all the information about your IP-NFT, including what kind of agreement will be connected to the IP-NFT and whether the agreement should be stored publicly or privately. All information in this step will be saved in the metadata of the IP-NFT and will be publicly available. - **Attach your signed legal agreement and artwork**: Upload the signed legal agreement from step 2 to the Molecule Platform. This document will be encrypted and stored on a decentralized data storage. Additionally, add artwork to become the memorable image of your IP-NFT. - **Review your IP-NFT data**: Review the data submitted for the IP-NFT. Once ready, continue the process. After submitting your data in this step, the contract will be encrypted and uploaded to the decentralized data storage. The decryption key will be stored with Lit Protocol to manage access control based on the NFT ownership. - **Sign IP-NFT minting transaction**: Your metamask will pop-up and ask you to sign a transaction to mint the IP-NFT. - **View your IP-NFT**: Once the transaction goes through, you will find an IP-NFT in your wallet. Congratulations, you have successfully created an IP-NFT!\n"

          "details": "Molecule Discovery is a platform that features various biopharma research projects from across the globe. Researchers present their projects in different therapeutic areas. The platform allows you to sort projects based on clinical stages and opportunity types. Additionally, there is a free text search option available to make it easier to find relevant research projects.\n\nMolecule Discovery offers user accounts that facilitate collaboration on various research projects. Researchers can create and manage their own projects using their accounts, while investors can inquire about projects and whitelist to fund researchers.\n\nMolecule's primary goal is to assist biopharma researchers in finding resources and partners to execute their research projects. One of the most common issues in early-stage biopharma research is the difficulty in acquiring funding and the length of time it takes to secure such funding. This issue can arise due to a variety of factors, such as complex contracts, limited access to funding sources, and challenges in aligning multiple stakeholders.\n\nTo address these obstacles, Molecule has developed a unique IP-NFT framework. Our team has created a set of standardized legal agreements that are linked to non-fungible tokens, enabling researchers to receive funding from existing early-stage investors. This approach aims to simplify the funding process and streamline the acquisition of necessary resources for biopharma research.\n"

          "shortTitle": "Bio DAO",
          "details": "A BioDAO is a type of Decentralized Autonomous Organisation (DAO) that uses decentralised services in the field of decentralised science (DeSci) to shape the future of therapeutic development. DAOs are made up of communities of individuals with diverse backgrounds who jointly allocate resources towards a common goal. When it comes to financial resources, public decentralised ledger technology such as Ethereum is used to enable all parties to collaborate in a trustless manner and democratically decide on how to allocate resources.\n\nOne of the key services offered by BioDAOs is the tokenization of intellectual property (IP) rights using non-fungible tokens (NFTs) to create liquid IP-NFTs. These IP-NFTs can be bought, held, managed, and sold by DAOs, allowing them to contribute to the advancement of science.\n\n#### Different Types of BioDAOs\n- **Community & Therapeutic Areas**: DAOs can be created by existing communities or individuals interested in a particular therapeutic area. Examples include VitaDAO and PsyDAO, which actively support research in their respective areas and educate the community through AMAs, Twitter Spaces, and other content.\n- **Nonprofits and Patient Organizations**: Nonprofits and patient organizations can be structured as DAOs to use Web3 fundraising mechanisms for public goods. This allows more people to take an active role in the BIO Ecosystem and support neglected and underfunded research areas. An excellent example is Crowdfunded Cures and To Cure a Rose, which create new value layers in the therapeutic space.\n- **Service Provider DAOs**: With the adoption of the IP-NFT standard and more efforts to conduct research in a decentralized way, we will see more DAOs actively building tools and services for researchers, such as LabDAO and CureDAO.\n- **Investment Syndicates**: DAOs don't have to consist of a large number of contributors; they can start as small as two individuals who collectively want to pool funds and support therapeutic research over our Discovery Platform as a Syndicate.\n- **BioLAOs**: A BioLAO is a community of BIO enthusiasts and experts who support the work of researchers and builders through advice and capital.\n\n#### The BIO DAO Lifecycle\nDAOs go through different stages, from an idea to a fully grown organization. The growth sequence for a BioDAO typically includes specific building blocks. Molecule provides support at each of these stages.\n"
