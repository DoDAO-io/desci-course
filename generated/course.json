      "details": "Smart contract auditing is the process of reviewing and testing the source code of a smart contract to identify any potential vulnerabilities or security issues. This can include checking for errors in the code, evaluating the contract's overall design and architecture, and testing the contract's functionality to ensure that it performs as intended. The goal of a smart contract audit is to ensure that the contract is secure and reliable, and that it will function as intended when deployed on a blockchain network.\n\n",

          "details": "> Decentralized science (DeSci) is a movement that aims to build public infrastructure for funding, creating, reviewing, crediting, storing, and disseminating scientific knowledge fairly and equitably using the Web3 stack â€“ Ethereum.org \n\nThere is a lot to unpack in this definition, with each term such as \"funding, creating, reviewing, crediting, storing, and disseminating\" requiring detailed explanation. Undoubtedly, science has played a major role in making the world a better place for humans than ever before. Private industry readily supports areas of innovation that promise short-term financial gains, while research in fields that lack direct monetary benefits, such as space exploration, bio research, and pollution control, rely heavily on government funding. Unfortunately, the outcomes of such research often prioritize theoretical publications over real-world impact.\n\nDeSci is an experimental field that takes cues from open-source software development, as well as DeFi and Decentralized Autonomous Organization concepts, to streamline and optimize the entire research process. By employing mechanisms such as public open grants, incentivized coordination, effort tracking, and reward distribution, DeSci aims to make research more efficient and effective.",

          "details": "Traditional way of science has led to many great outcomes but over the years the entire process has deteriorated as it has not been able to keep up with the pace of technology. Many of the problems faced in the Traditional Science institutions are same as faced by government bodies and that is primarily because science and the decision making is has become very centralized. Also the focus has moved away from impact to more towards publishing research papers. Below we discuss some of the biggest problems that are faced in the current Traditional Science industry. \n\n## Funding\nFunding problems in science exist both in public and private sectors. The challenges faced in private sector by science startups is same or in fact more intense than other startup as the product turnaround time in science startups is quite longer and the investment needed for hardware or initial setup is also relatively quite high. Private VCs invest purely based on risk/reward and not based on the impact.   \n\nIn the public space, the grant mechanisms that government entities use are often outdated and favour the veterans of the fields. Normally it is easier to get funding for newer initiatives, which means that the focus of the grantees is more towards wrapping up the existing project and then starting on a new initiative, rather than making sure that the current project has long term usefulness. \n\nThe way the grants are distributed are also biased, and its more of the field veterans giving grants to other veterans making it very difficult for new members to  ",
