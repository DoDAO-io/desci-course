          "details": "Molecule DAO is an ambitious project aimed at revolutionizing the drug development industry. With a vision to create an open marketplace that connects patients directly with researchers, Molecule DAO seeks to democratize access to funding for promising early-stage therapeutic research. The team behind Molecule DAO believes that by utilizing a combination of unique digital asset identifiers (NFTs), automatic exchange infrastructure, and governance structures, they can reinvent IP ownership and financing of these assets in a decentralized manner. Ultimately, Molecule DAO hopes to create a new creator economy for researchers that allows for the rapid funding, discovery, and development of therapeutics through globally connected patient collectives. In this introduction, we explore the challenges that the drug development industry currently faces and how Molecule DAO aims to address them.\n\nMolecule operates across three different areas: protocol development, marketplace creation, and BioDAO launchpad.\n\nFirstly, Molecule has created a new protocol called IP-NFT (Intellectual Property - Non-Fungible Token) which combines legal and smart contract primitives. This protocol enables the tokenization of intellectual property and research data, allowing for the creation of cryptographic tokens on the Ethereum blockchain. These tokens unify the legal rights, data access, and economics around research projects, allowing for more efficient and transparent management of research funding.\n\nSecondly, Molecule is building a marketplace on top of the IP-NFT protocol, called Molecule Discovery. The marketplace enables researchers and funders to connect and collaborate on translational research projects. Researchers can propose research ideas, which are evaluated by funders and negotiated on the platform, resulting in funding agreements. The marketplace aims to improve the funding process for research projects by providing a more streamlined and transparent platform for collaboration.\n\nThirdly, Molecule operates a BioDAO launchpad, which incubates decentralized biotech IP and R&D organizations called BioDAOs. These communities consist of patients, researchers, and enthusiasts who come together to fund research in specific therapeutic areas. The BioDAO launchpad fosters demand and supply for the marketplace by incubating and supporting BioDAOs through an accelerator program. This program helps to create a new class of decentralized biotech organizations that can help to accelerate the development of new therapeutics and treatments.\n"

          "key": "ip-nft",
          "title": "IP-NFT",
          "shortTitle": "IP-NFT",
          "details": "#### What is IP-NFT?\n\nIP-NFT stands for Intellectual Property - Non-Fungible Token. Molecule created the first IP-NFTs for [VitaDAO](https://www.vitadao.com/), which enabled them to register their intellectual property and research and development data rights for their sponsored research in longevity therapeutics. By attaching legal contracts such as sponsored research agreements to smart contracts, IP-NFTs connect IP and R&D data rights to NFTs on the [Ethereum](https://www.ethereum.org/) blockchain. IP-NFTs serve as the [building blocks](https://molecule.to/blog/ip-nfts-for-researchers-a-new-biomedical-funding-paradigm) for decentralized science (DeSci), much like [DeFi legos](https://www.defipulse.com/blog/what-is-defi) for DeSci. They represent a new paradigm in the evolution of legal contracts for scientific research, moving from paper or electronic file folders to smart contracts on the Ethereum blockchain. IP-NFTs can be transferred peer-to-peer, made [composable](https://blog.aragon.org/what-is-composability/) with DeFi, fractionalized to distribute licenses and governance to groups of people. They can also be built upon to unlock new ways to interact with and develop IP, R&D data, and [NIPIA](https://www.aaup.org/sites/default/files/files/IntangibleAssets.pdf) (Non-IP Intangible Assets). \n\n#### Why mint an IP-NFT?\n\nAn IP-NFT can be minted by a research sponsor, biotech company, or researcher to benefit from the attachment of intellectual property (IP) and research and development (R&D) rights to an Ethereum smart contract. As described above, the benefits of IP-NFTs include:\n- Permissionless peer-to-peer transferability as smart contracts on Ethereum - Composability with DeFi - Fractionalization for the distribution of licenses and governance to groups of individuals - Development of new ways to interact with and develop IP, R&D data, and Non-IP Intangible Assets (NIPIA) such as trade secrets and publicity rights - Empowerment of crowd control of ethics in commercialization based on FRAND terms - Unprecedented liquidity in IP markets\n\nIn addition, IP-NFTs offer non-dilutive funding opportunities for researchers seeking to sell IP and data rights without having to apply for grants or sell shares of spin-off companies. Once an IP-NFT is minted, the user has attached the specified IP, NIPIA, and R&D data rights to a non-fungible token on Ethereum. These rights transfer with the token when it is transferred, providing ease of transferability and verified ownership of rights through the blockchain.\nOther reasons to mint IP-NFTs include:\n- **Composability with DeFi**: IP-NFTs can be used as building blocks in DeSci and [mixed with other software components like lego bricks](https://twitter.com/cdixon/status/1451703070589587456?s=20&t=GsFYFskx2cmqYnUjL1PGuw). For instance, they can be used as collateral to mint stablecoins in MakerDAO, traded on marketplaces like [OpenSea](https://opensea.io/) and [Gem](https://www.gem.xyz/), or listed in a bespoke IP marketplace like [Molecule Discovery](https://molecule.to/blog/an-open-bazaar-for-drug-development-molecule-protocol). Fractionalization (IP-NFT fractionalization is a technique that allows for the direct distribution of IP-NFT rights to groups of token holders by locking the IP-NFT and generating tokens on Ethereum that represent fractions of the locked IP-NFT) is also possible on platforms like [Fractional.art](http://www.fractional.art/) and the FRENS & FAM legal+smart contract protocol.\n- **Creation of efficiencies in IP licensing**: IP-NFTs provide transparency in IP ownership and valuation, which can make due diligence for licensing deals easier and less costly.\n- **Creation of entirely new IP markets**: Early-stage IP-NFTs can represent rights to future IP arising from a research project, while late-stage IP-NFTs can represent trade secrets and patents on inventions that arise from the project. Licensing terms, ethical conditions, and governance clauses can be encoded into IP-NFTs as license wrappers. This allows for efficient trading of IP rights before pursuing patents and the potential for a Cambrian explosion of novel applications for decentralized IP ownership, governance, and commercialization.\n\nTo mint an IP-NFT using Molecule, follow these steps:\n\n- **Request a mintpass**: Minting of IP-NFTs on Molecule is currently in closed beta, so you'll need to request a mintpass to get started. You can request [here](https://airtable.com/shr9QN0tPPeK4GGjA). - **Create and sign a legal agreement**: Two parties must negotiate and sign a legal contract that includes two agreements. The first agreement states the rights of the asset holder and the price paid for the asset, while the second agreement assigns the rights of the buyer within the first agreement to the holder of a certain token of the IP-NFT smart contract. - **Access the minting front-end**: Visit the [minting front-end](https://mint.molecule.to/) and connect your wallet to get started with the process. - **Reserve an IP-NFT**: To enable the encryption of your documents, Molecule reserves a TokenID for your NFT. This TokenID will be used to ensure that only the owner of the TokenID can access the data behind the NFT. - **Describe your IP-NFT**: Add all the information about your IP-NFT, including what kind of agreement will be connected to the IP-NFT and whether the agreement should be stored publicly or privately. All information in this step will be saved in the metadata of the IP-NFT and will be publicly available. - **Attach your signed legal agreement and artwork**: Upload the signed legal agreement from step 2 to the Molecule Platform. This document will be encrypted and stored on a decentralized data storage. Additionally, add artwork to become the memorable image of your IP-NFT. - **Review your IP-NFT data**: Review the data submitted for the IP-NFT. Once ready, continue the process. After submitting your data in this step, the contract will be encrypted and uploaded to the decentralized data storage. The decryption key will be stored with Lit Protocol to manage access control based on the NFT ownership. - **Sign IP-NFT minting transaction**: Your metamask will pop-up and ask you to sign a transaction to mint the IP-NFT. - **View your IP-NFT**: Once the transaction goes through, you will find an IP-NFT in your wallet. Congratulations, you have successfully created an IP-NFT!\n"

          "details": "Molecule Discovery is a platform that features various biopharma research projects from across the globe. Researchers present their projects in different therapeutic areas. The platform allows you to sort projects based on clinical stages and opportunity types. Additionally, there is a free text search option available to make it easier to find relevant research projects.\n\nMolecule Discovery offers user accounts that facilitate collaboration on various research projects. Researchers can create and manage their own projects using their accounts, while investors can inquire about projects and whitelist to fund researchers.\n\nMolecule's primary goal is to assist biopharma researchers in finding resources and partners to execute their research projects. One of the most common issues in early-stage biopharma research is the difficulty in acquiring funding and the length of time it takes to secure such funding. This issue can arise due to a variety of factors, such as complex contracts, limited access to funding sources, and challenges in aligning multiple stakeholders.\n\nTo address these obstacles, Molecule has developed a unique IP-NFT framework. Our team has created a set of standardized legal agreements that are linked to non-fungible tokens, enabling researchers to receive funding from existing early-stage investors. This approach aims to simplify the funding process and streamline the acquisition of necessary resources for biopharma research.\n"

          "key": "biodao",
          "title": "Bio DAO",
          "shortTitle": "Bio DAO",
          "details": "A BioDAO is a type of Decentralized Autonomous Organisation (DAO) that uses decentralised services in the field of decentralised science (DeSci) to shape the future of therapeutic development. DAOs are made up of communities of individuals with diverse backgrounds who jointly allocate resources towards a common goal. When it comes to financial resources, public decentralised ledger technology such as Ethereum is used to enable all parties to collaborate in a trustless manner and democratically decide on how to allocate resources.\n\nOne of the key services offered by BioDAOs is the tokenization of intellectual property (IP) rights using non-fungible tokens (NFTs) to create liquid IP-NFTs. These IP-NFTs can be bought, held, managed, and sold by DAOs, allowing them to contribute to the advancement of science.\n\n#### Different Types of BioDAOs\n- **Community & Therapeutic Areas**: DAOs can be created by existing communities or individuals interested in a particular therapeutic area. Examples include VitaDAO and PsyDAO, which actively support research in their respective areas and educate the community through AMAs, Twitter Spaces, and other content.\n- **Nonprofits and Patient Organizations**: Nonprofits and patient organizations can be structured as DAOs to use Web3 fundraising mechanisms for public goods. This allows more people to take an active role in the BIO Ecosystem and support neglected and underfunded research areas. An excellent example is Crowdfunded Cures and To Cure a Rose, which create new value layers in the therapeutic space.\n- **Service Provider DAOs**: With the adoption of the IP-NFT standard and more efforts to conduct research in a decentralized way, we will see more DAOs actively building tools and services for researchers, such as LabDAO and CureDAO.\n- **Investment Syndicates**: DAOs don't have to consist of a large number of contributors; they can start as small as two individuals who collectively want to pool funds and support therapeutic research over our Discovery Platform as a Syndicate.\n- **BioLAOs**: A BioLAO is a community of BIO enthusiasts and experts who support the work of researchers and builders through advice and capital.\n\n#### The BIO DAO Lifecycle\nDAOs go through different stages, from an idea to a fully grown organization. The growth sequence for a BioDAO typically includes specific building blocks. Molecule provides support at each of these stages.\n"

          "details": "Over the last 20 years, open-source code has accelerated progress in information technology by enabling the sharing of code at a low cost and with high reliability. The sharing of code is facilitated by technology market dynamics, in which intellectual property is less relevant than the ability to execute, time to market, and trade secrets around implementation.\nHowever, open-source biomedicine is still waiting for its moment. Progress in biomedicine has been slowed down by the high cost of reproducing life science processes and the low reliability of generating expected results. Sharing instructions is hampered by intellectual property and trade secrets, the primary mode of defense against competitors during the lengthy regulatory approval processes seen in the life science industry.\nWhile cloud computing providers have removed the barriers to executing code by moving hardware online, there is no comparable layer of abstraction for dry-lab and wet-lab tools in biomedicine. LabDAO believes that an open-source exchange for dry-lab and wet-lab tools could help reduce the high costs created by secrecy around biomedical tooling, increase the reproducibility of biomedical tools, and foster the emergence of independent entities that maintain open-source tools.\n\n#### Solution\n\nTo accelerate progress, LabDAO enables scientists to share their specialized tools and services with each other easily. Researchers can discover tools and projects on an open exchange instead of going through a lengthy search for collaborators or service providers.\nLabDAO's approach involves creating an open exchange of wet-lab and dry-lab tooling, defining standards around biomedical tools to increase reproducibility and transparency, and incentivizing contributors to develop applications and provide instrumentation. LabDAO believes that abstracted infrastructure, such as cloud computing, has lowered the upfront cost of starting a new technology company. Similarly, they are convinced that such abstracted infrastructure in biomedicine, both in the dry-lab and wet-lab domain, can facilitate the growth of new life science companies.\n"

          "details": "To better understand LabDAO's approach, let's first have a look on what is an effective research environment.\n\n#### What defines an effective research environment?\n\nAn effective research environment is crucial for scientists to achieve their goals. The following factors define such an environment:\n- Access to Scientific Infrastructure: The availability of scientific infrastructure is paramount for scientists to conduct targeted tinkering. New methods and technologies that allow for a novel approach to discovering something about the world are often crucial for scientific breakthroughs. In order to make progress, scientists need to have access to the tools and equipment necessary to conduct their experiments.\n- Dynamic Teams: The ability to form dynamic teams is also an important component of an effective research environment. Unlike traditional labs where teams are formed around a professor, dynamic teams are often project-focused and assembled to solve a particular problem or address a specific need. Such teams allow for micro-expertise, where individuals with specialized skills can come together to tackle a specific scientific challenge.\n- Funding to Develop Infrastructure and Accelerate Inventors: Funding is crucial for scientists to develop initial infrastructure and accelerate their inventions. A smooth project size distribution, as proposed by Ben Reinhardt, is necessary to achieve this. This means that funding should be available to grow a project from just an idea to a research project, and eventually to a serious technology company. Such funding can come from a variety of sources, including government grants, venture capital firms, and philanthropic organizations.\n\n#### Where does LabDAO come in?\n\nIn recent times, there has been a surge in various projects that are aimed at supporting scientific research through funding agencies and execution agencies, as well as distribution mechanisms. However, the middle ground where scientists and their tools can interact is missing, which is where LabDAO comes in with its focus on team and tool development. LabDAO's mission is to provide a space where scientists can collaborate and access the necessary tools to generate and distribute their research.\nOne of the challenges in decentralized science is bringing tools into an online room where they can be utilized effectively. A crucial question to address is how to bring tools like a cell culture bench into an online chat room. LabDAO's answer is to create a marketplace protocol where labs can offer their services and share them in a structured format. This approach will enable scientists to access the necessary tools and generate new data, which they can then distribute. LabDAO's focus on building a supportive ecosystem for scientific research provides a promising avenue for scientists to collaborate, access necessary tools, and distribute their research effectively. To achieve their mission, LabDAO has categorized the exchange for laboratory services under Lab Exchange and the set of required tools under Lab Teams. Let's have a look.\n#### Lab Exchange\n\nLabExchange is a peer-to-peer exchange for laboratory services that operates under a DAO governance structure. It offers a marketplace protocol where laboratories can provide data-generating services such as testing the binding behavior of a specific target or synthesizing small molecules. The exchange is currently in its early stages, and its client, which is designed for computational biologists, is pre-release. The exchange lists available apps, ranging from simple functions like reverse complement to complex ones like protein folding, and allows data sharing via the InterPlanetary File System (IPFS) and Estuary.\nLabExchange aims to create a structured format for laboratories to offer their services and for teams of scientists and their tools to interact. It provides \"lab teams\" as a way for scientists to collaborate and become discoverable by people with micro-expertise. The marketplace protocol enables laboratories, both for-profit and non-profit, to share their services, which scientists can use to generate new data. The goal is to create an online space where tools like a cell culture bench can be brought into an online chat room, allowing scientists to access specific services and generate new data. While the protocol is still in its early stages, it provides a promising avenue for scientific research.\n\n#### Lab Teams\n\nLabTeams are a crucial component of enabling scientific progress and collaboration through dynamic team formation among scientists. The role of subject matter stewards in leading a group and guiding expert attention is important for initiating projects and facilitating conversations. However, to effectively concentrate expertise, there needs to be tools for collective intelligence that allow even outsiders to contribute their micro expertise.\nIn order to encourage scientists to contribute to the LabDAO, there are onboarding flows that explain decentralized science and take users through a step-by-step process to join the community. The LabDAO is a community of people focused on specific problems, project ideas, or open-source repositories, where labs develop their own culture and track their contributions. Through this open-source community, standardizations around laboratory services can emerge, leading to many-to-many relationships and providing physical laboratory services to online research communities.\nLabDAO's approach to creating a marketplace protocol where laboratories can offer their services and share them in a structured format addresses the challenge of bringing tools like a cell culture bench into an online chat room. With LabTeams, scientists can collaborate, access necessary tools, and generate new data to distribute their research effectively. By creating a supportive ecosystem for scientific research, LabDAO provides a promising avenue for scientific progress and collaboration.\n"

          "details": "#### Introducing PLEX\n\nTo purse the DeSci future, LabDAO has a goal to make Bio ML tools more accessible and clinically relevant. In a quest to build best-in-class tools, they have built tools for Small Molecule Binding and Protein Folding initially, so that you don’t have to spend days researching and setting up Bio ML tools.\n#### What is PLEX?\n\nPLEX is a piece of software that allows you to run computational biology tools using simple commands from your computer.\nPLEX manages all the required dependencies and installations, to make the tools as easy to run as possible.\nWhen you run a tool, PLEX requests compute-time from members of the LabDAO network, so you don’t have to worry about hardware requirements for setting up the necessary compute infrastructure.\n#### What is Small Molecule Binding?\n\nThe concept of small molecule binding involves investigating the interaction between a small molecule and a target, typically a protein. The process involves bringing the small molecule and the target into proximity, either through in silico or laboratory methods, with the aim of determining whether there is binding between them. The key questions that need to be answered are whether the small molecule binds to the protein and, if so, what is the strength of this interaction. The strength of the interaction is commonly known as the \"binding affinity\".\n#### Introduction to Small Molecule Binding Affinity\n\nSmall molecule binding affinity refers to the strength of the interaction between a small molecule and a target, typically a protein.\n#### Importance of Determining Binding Affinity\n\nDetermining the binding affinity is crucial as a strong interaction increases the likelihood that the drug candidate's clinical effect is due to its interaction with the target, rather than other structures in the organism. It helps to understand the target of the drug candidate and make informed decisions to increase success in later phases of drug discovery.\nIt is recommended to determine the binding affinity early in the drug discovery process to ensure that only candidates with strong binding affinity to their target protein are selected for further development.\n#### Predicting Binding Affinity\n\nMachine learning models can be utilized to predict the binding affinity of a small molecule and protein. LabDAO offers computational tools that use molecular docking to dock the small molecule and protein, and score the predicted interaction. The score, as well as two separate files showing the small molecule and protein, will be returned for further exploration.\n#### Describing Binding Affinity\n\nThe binding affinity can be described with three related metrics: ΔG (binding free energy), Kd (dissociation constant), and IC50 (half-maximal inhibitory concentration). ΔG is the most generalizable metric to describe binding affinity, while IC50 is highly context-dependent.\n#### Interpreting Binding Affinity\n\nBinding affinity data can be interpreted by comparing the ΔG, Kd, or IC50 values to a set of reference values for the target. A lower value of these metrics implies a stronger interaction between the small molecule and target protein. A strong interaction is indicated by a negative ΔG value, Kd or IC50 close to 0.\n#### Measuring Binding Affinity in the Lab\n\nSurface-Plasmon-Resonance (SPR) and Bio-layer Interferometry (BLI) are popular, accurate, and label-free methods used to measure the binding affinity of a protein and small molecule in the lab. The cost of an average SPR experiment can range from several thousand dollars to tens of thousands of dollars, depending on the experiment's complexity and equipment used.\n#### Tools for Predicting Binding Affinity\n\nThere is a wide range of tools available for predicting the binding affinity between small molecules and proteins. To help you navigate this landscape, we have researched and compiled a list of tools that are ready for use on PLEX.\nPlease note that all models provided are research-grade software and are provided \"as-is\". While they can be helpful for predicting binding affinity, they should not be considered a substitute for laboratory experiments.\nMini: Equibind Equibind is a machine learning-based docking tool that is extremely fast. While it may be less accurate than some baseline methods, it is orders of magnitude faster, making it a good choice for certain applications.\nBase: Gnina (Coming Soon) Gnina is a sampling and machine learning-based docking tool that is considered a current open source baseline. It is an implementation of Smina, which is a fork of Vina.\nStandard: Diffdock Diffdock is a machine learning-based docking tool that is reportedly faster and more accurate than existing baseline tools.\n"
