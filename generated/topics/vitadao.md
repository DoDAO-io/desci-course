## VitaDAO
 
VitaDAO is a cooperative organization for community-governed and decentralized drug development with the mission to accelerate research and development in the longevity space. They aim to democratize early-stage longevity research, which is lacking critical funding, by using a combination of novel governance frameworks and decentralized autonomous organizations (DAOs), non-fungible tokens (NFTs), and financial engineering tools. VitaDAO's ownership and governance are governed by VITA tokens, which can be obtained by contributing work, funds, or other resources. VitaDAO aims to acquire and finance new therapeutics and research data in the longevity space, and directly hold IP rights in novel early-stage therapeutics. They plan to create entirely new open IP business models that promote open science and new data marketplaces.
